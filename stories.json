[{"content":["Growing up, I really hated frogs. And I mean I seriously despised the slimy little bastards. You probably would too, if everybody said you looked like one...\n\nAt school, the cruel jokes never stopped. Kids would follow me around going 'ribbit' and worm the word ‘croak’ into every other sentence. Then one morning, as I shoulder charged my way along a busy corridor, an older boy took one look at me and said, “Hey Kermit.”\n\nEven the principal laughed. And so, from that day forth,"," I was known only as…Kermit.\n\nNow what made these frog-related taunts *especially* ironic was the fact my mom looked like a fairy-tale princess. She had long dark hair that draped past her shoulders and striking green eyes. Anytime she came within a half-mile of the school, my classmates would all say, “Your mom's a total babe, Kermit.”\n\nThinking about her now, some two decades later, still gets me choked up. Unfortunately, my daughter’s reached the age where she’s become a mini-KGB"," officer. Her nonstop questions are (mostly) a rapid-fire barrage of harmless nonsense—*Have you ever ridden a hot air balloon Daddy? What’s your favorite color hamster?*—but every so often, she’ll ask an especially tricky one. Like *what’s wrong with your hands?* Or, *how come I’ve only got two grandparents?*\n\nFor years I’ve danced around the story of how my family fell apart, but now seems as good a time as any to dredge up some bad memories.\n\nSee, when I was a boy, my mom took"," me on these treasure hunts. We’d traipse up and down the beach behind our cottage, through stinking seaweed and crab shells. And all the while, she’d hum this soft little tune. *Dee...deedee…dundadee.*\n\nWhen I asked Mom what she hoped to find out there, she’d say she couldn’t really remember, only that it was big and grey.\n\n“But lots of things are big and grey,” I said. “How would we know we’ve found the right one?”\n\nShe closed her eyes, her expression all wistful. “Because it’ll"," feel wet and slimy.”\n\nAnd so, without actually knowing what to search for, we rummaged through broken bottles, kelp, rusted coke cans, and whatever else washed up onshore.\n\nDad never joined these hunts. He spent his days out on boats and his nights drinking in a little pub called the Harbour Inn, where he'd show off pictures of Mom and say, 'quite a catch, huh?'. Most nights he'd stagger home, completely pissed, sometime after 2 AM, stinking of both fish guts and whiskey.\n\nEvery"," so often he'd insist Mom go find a job to help earn some money, even though things never ended well. Because of her terrible memory, Mom either forgot to turn off an oven or return from her lunch break on time. She couldn’t stomach criticism, either. Sooner or later, a co-worker would remark about how she styled her hair or wore her makeup, then she’d quit on the spot.\n\nGiven her bull-headedness and the general effect she had on men, I never understood why she stayed with Dad."," There was plenty of fish in the sea, after all. And he treated her like something stuck to the bottom of his boot. She wasn’t exactly short of suitors, either—during our treasure hunts, countless guys invented flimsy excuses to chat her up.\n\nOn Saturdays, my old man made me join him on fishing expeditions so he could teach me how to properly navigate waves. The two of us went out on this little rowboat with our fishing poles, and anytime I made a catch he'd thump my back hard"," and say, “You’re a chip off the old block.”\n\nAlthough only in his thirties, a hard upbringing meant Dad looked much, much older. He also stood taller and broader than any other person in our sleepy village.\n\nA few miles off the coast, there was this tiny island, and every time we rowed past, Dad would point to this crude pile of rocks in the centre and say, “I built that memorial for your grandfather.\"\n\nThen he'd inevitably recount the story of how one day, while out fishing,"," a storm erupted out of nowhere, tossing him, his father, and their crewmates around until an especially violent wave made the ship's trawler snap. It whipped right around and took Grandpa's left leg clean off.\n\n\"We made for that island and tried to clamp his wound,\" Dad would say, fighting back emotion, \"but it was already too late.”\n\nMy old man insisted I’d become a great fisherman someday. But secretly, I hated fishing, almost as much as frogs. I hated the awkward motion of"," the boat. I hated the salty sea air. I hated that chafing wind that turned your cheeks red. And above all, I hated the noisy gulls, who always sounded like they were laughing. Those cackles reminded me of the kids at school.\n\nOne evening, at the dinner table, I worked up the nerve to say all this.\n\n“What are you talking about?” Dad slammed his fist against the table hard enough to make the plates rattle and bounce.\n\n“Well…fishing’s boring and it makes your clothes all stinky.”\n\nMom"," shot me a look, silently advising I drop the subject. It was too late for that, though. “And you’re away all the time,” I said to Dad. “If it wasn’t for our lessons, I don’t think I’d remember what you look like.”\n\nWithout warning, he reached over and gave my wrist a sudden tug. I got pinned against the table, the whole right side of my face buried in a mountain of mashed potatoes.\n\nWhile I pleaded for help and struggled to break free, Mom jumped up and furiously pried Dad off"," my arm. “Enough,” she shouted. “He doesn’t know what he’s saying.”\n\nAs suddenly as Dad’s rage appeared, it evaporated. He released my arm and said, “We’ll talk about this later.”\n\nThen he grabbed his coat and stormed off, presumably to the Harbour Inn.\n\nWarm gravy ran down my chin and dripped onto the floor.\n\nAlone with Mom, I said, “Sorry I made him mad Mommy.”\n\nShe gestured for me to sit on her lap, cradled me into her chest like a teddy bear, and then picked lumps of potato"," out of my hair. “That’s okay, darling. It’s not your fault.”\n\nSometimes after midnight, a fierce argument erupted downstairs. I tiptoed to the top of the staircase to listen in. After a few minutes of stomping around the ground floor, my father's voice grew louder and angrier until there was a sudden thump. Everything went quiet after that.\n\nThe next morning, Mom had an ugly purple bruise beneath her left eye.\n\nThat summer, the two of us went treasure hunting almost every day."," The second my eyes opened I'd rush into her room to remind her it was time to go, otherwise, it would completely slip her mind.\n\nAround July time she began to suspect her lost thing wasn’t actually on the beach, so we searched the village and surrounding hills, constantly on the lookout for something big and grey.\n\n“Why would what you lost be all the way out here?” I asked one afternoon, as we picnicked on a grassy knoll overlooking the coast. “When I lose my marbles, they’re"," always close by, like in my sock or under my bed.” I bit into my fruit scone while Mom nibbled on her tuna sandwich.\n\n“Because your fathers a *very* sneaky man,” she replied, matter-of-factly.\n\nWhen I screwed up my face, she sighed and said, “You see darling, I always thought I’d lost my precious thing. Eleven years ago I met your father, and we had a lot of fun together. It was never meant to be long-term, and I certainly didn’t like the idea of cooking and cleaning for anyone,"," but one day I woke up and my precious thing was gone. Without it, I couldn’t leave. So I stuck around, expecting it'd turn up sooner or later, then before I knew it you came along.” She gave my cheek a quick peck. “But that night you made him angry, he came home drunk, and we got into a huge row. Well, one thing led to another and he let slip that he’s stolen what I thought I’d lost. After all these years, to discover what he’d done, I slapped him so hard it left a mark, then"," he grabbed me by the neck and threw me against the wall. The next morning, his hangover was so bad he forgot about what happened.”\n\nUnsure how else how to respond, I simply said, “I’m sorry Mommy.”\n\n“That’s okay darling. But unless I find what I lost, my memory’s only going to get worse.”\n\n“Then we better find it fast.”\n\nThat made her smile. The two of us off after gathering our things, her humming that soft tune. *Dee...deedee…dundadee.*\n\nShe made me promise not to repeat any"," of this to Dad, but at that age, what kids any good at keeping secrets? The next time he took me fishing, he picked up on my quiet demeanor. “What’s the matter with you?”\n\n“Nothing,” I replied, keeping my eyes glued to the waves.\n\nThe moment one of his giant hands clamped over my shoulder, a confession practically spewed out. My heart thudded wildly against my chest as it did. Dad may have been an expert fisherman, but he lacked the temperament for fatherhood, and Mom wasn’t around"," to cool his temper.\n\nAt that moment, it occurred to me she maybe only stayed with Dad so I wouldn’t have to fend for myself…\n\nThe wind died and the waves calmed while both of us sat in utter silence.\n\nEventually, he said, “You did the right thing by telling me.”\n\nAlready there were tears in my eyes, no doubt because of my own sense of shame. I wiped them away and said, “Maybe if you gave back what you stole, Mommy would be so grateful she’d forgive you, and then she’d stop forgetting"," things?”\n\n“This *thing* your moms looking for. If she found it, she’d disappear forever. And you’d never, *ever* see her again.” There was a stern warning in his voice.\n\n“No.”\n\n“She’d disappear, son. You don’t want that to happen do you?”\n\nSaying nothing, I bit my bottom lip and shook my head.\n\n“Good.” He stared off into the horizon. “In any case, you needn’t worry. That stupid woman could pull the village apart brick by brick and never find what she’s looking for.”\n\nOn our next"," treasure hunt, I kept my lip buttoned about what Dad said. Me and Mom were having so much fun together—the thought of her leaving made me nauseous, and the idea of living with Pops, no mediator around to cool his temper, absolutely terrified me.\n\nIn the summer of ’99, as Mom and I strolled out of the theatre after watching Star Wars, she forgot the entire movie before we’d even crossed the lobby. Her memory had never been *that* bad before.\n\nIt was only the beginning. Over the"," next few weeks, she’d nip out to buy groceries and get lost on the way home, or need to spend a full minute concentrating extra hard just to remember my name. Since Dad had me to keep her out of trouble he stayed largely ignorant of all this, although the way she constantly trailed off mid-sentence quickly wore down his patience. Glass bottles started flying in my direction anytime she lost her train of thought.\n\nOne afternoon, as Mom sat on a stool in our back garden and stared"," at the ocean waves, I clasped her hand and said, “Is everything okay, Mommy?”\n\nShe reared up in her seat, her face terribly pale. “Oh, it’s you. Yes, sweetheart…I think so.” She let out a deep sigh, that flicker of recognition already fading.\n\nAt that moment it became painfully clear we couldn’t carry on like this. If we did, Mom would wither away. There was no choice other than to help her, whatever the consequences.\n\nI pulled her to her feet. “C’mon, let’s go.”\n\n“Where to?”"," she asked, letting me lead her around like an eager puppy.\n\n“On a treasure hunt.”\n\nI pushed my old man’s rowboat into the ocean, letting it bob on the back of a few limp waves until we were deep enough to start paddling. For once, I found myself grateful Dad made me take all those dumb lessons.\n\nAt Grandpa’s Island, I jumped into the waist-deep water—my toes going numb in an instant—and marooned the boat on a beach of pebbles. I’d secretly known Dad’s hiding spot for a while.\n\nThe"," island was really just a big rock, and in the center lay Grandpa’s memorial; a crude pyramid of smaller rocks. My fleece became a damp rag against my back as I pulled the structure apart, piece by piece. Nearby, Mom sat in a dream-like state.\n\nAfter lifting away an especially slippery, moss-covered stone, I saw something poking out from underneath: a burlap sack, so badly rotted there was a hole in the side. The beginnings of a grey object poked through.\n\n“Mom, I think I found"," it,” I shouted, practically jumping up and down. The thing inside the sack had the consistency of pickled eggs and carried a damp, fungal scent.\n\n“Mom?” I held her shoulders so she had to face me.\n\nHer eyes stared off over my shoulder, toward the yellow and orange horizon. I cupped my eyes, squinted into the distance, and saw there was a boat sailing straight toward us.\n\nIt was Dad. He'd likely arrived home, discovered his rowboat missing, and put two and two together. I had to"," act fast...\n\nPulling down the rest of the structure was bitter work; soon there were blood blisters all over my hands.\n\nAfter tossing aside the final rock, I hoisted the sack onto my shoulder with a loud grunt and said, “Mom, I found it. Look.”\n\nShe sat motionless, as though hypnotized by a stage magician. I had no idea what her lost thing was or how it might help, plus now Dad was less than a few minutes away. When he got his hands on me, he’d be furious—so furious he might have"," to build *another* memorial.\n\nWe had to set sail. Hopefully, Mom would become lucid again before Dad caught up.\n\nI guided her into the boat and lay the sack across her lap, but before we could even cast off, Dad marooned *his* boat, jumped into the water, and grabbed our stern, holding us in place.\n\n“Give that to me,” he demanded.\n\n“No,” I said, angrily. “Mom’s sick. She’s sick, and this’ll help her feel better.”\n\n“It won’t make her better it’ll make her leave. Is that what you"," want?”\n\n“Better she leaves than stays like this.”\n\nHe clenched his jaw and stuck me in the left temple, which knocked me onto the wooden boards. I rolled from side to side, clutching my burning eye socket. At that moment, Dad was prepared to kill me. Better his family passed away in a freak boating accident than abandon him for being an asshole, right?\n\nThe violent action snapped Mom out of her daze. She fumbled for words. “Who said that? What happened? Where—”\n\nAs her eyes flicked"," between me, Dad, and the thing on her lap, the realization hit her like a lightning bolt.\n\nDad tried to snatch her object away, but Mom held on tight and went along with it. The rotted sack practically disintegrated as the two of them wrestled around, then the thing inside fell out and slumped over the bow. Whatever it was kinda looked like a wetsuit.\n\nDad seized Mom's wrists before she could scoop it up. Still feeling every heartbeat along the left side of my face, I fumbled"," around, grabbed a paddle, bounced up, and then brought the end down across the back of Dad's head. His upper torso sprawled forward, into the boat.\n\nRubbing the swollen goose egg already forming around the back of his skull, he straightened up, pupils badly dilated. Before he could lunge at Mom a second time, I threw myself between them and held out the paddle like a shield while she fumbled around.\n\nWith barely any effort Dad wrestled away my oar, the boat tipping wildly to the"," port side. Saltwater splashed over all three of us as he repeatedly struck me in the face, and then stars danced in front of my eyes.\n\nI vaguely remember lying flat on my back, a river of blood spewing from my nostrils, and watching a hazy, upside-down Mom slide the wetsuit-thing up her legs and torso. It made a noise like dog food escaping from a tin.\n\nDad made one final, desperate attempt to stop her by leaping forward, arms outstretched. The sudden shift in weight rocked the"," boat, almost to the point of tipping to the starboard side, but then both my parents plummeted overboard. The vessel quickly rebalanced, taking on a little water.\n\nA column of white foam hissed into the air. It was followed by a sharp yelp. Then, gurgles.\n\nI rolled onto my stomach and peeked over the side, just in time to watch a stream of bubbles disappear.\n\nQuickly the water turned light pink. Then a grey skull, capped by a single dorsal fin, appeared beneath the surface. As"," two webbed hands reached out of the water and wrapped around the side of the boat, I scrambled away, fumbling wildly for a paddle or a rock, for anything to defend myself with.\n\nDirectly in front of me, a sea creature hoisted itself into view. The humanoid beast had fish-like scales, seaweed-coloured hair straggling from the top of a wet skull, and deep, green eyes.\n\nThe creature's mouth widened, revealing countless rows of serrated teeth. It slowly raised a webbed hand, identical"," to mine in all ways except color. And then it made a series of liquid gurgles. Those sounds followed a simple pattern: *Dee...deedee…dundadee.*\n\nI studied my hands. My stupid, ugly, webbed hands; the same ones that earned me the nickname 'Kermit'.\n\nAnd as I gazed into the creature’s eyes—those familiar green eyes—it became clear *who* exactly I was gazing at.\n\n“Mom?”\n\n\\--\n\nIn the years since that fateful day, I’ve learned all about selkies, a sea folk capable of shedding their"," skin to transform into beautiful women. Pop down to the local library, and you'll find countless fairytales about cruel men stealing selkies' skin to coerce them to stay on land and have children, ones who can be identified by their webbed hands.\n\nBut selkies aren’t meant to live on land. Not permanently, at least. They either return to the sea or slowly wither away, like my mother.\n\nThere is, however, one part the old stories always get wrong. They say once selkies return to"," the ocean, their families never see them again. Today marks the twenty-third anniversary of my mom recovering her skin, and every year, at Grandpa’s Island, she emerges from the ocean, transforms back into a human, and we have ourselves a family reunion.\n\nI told everyone my parents drowned that day. But this year, my daughter’s finally old enough to know the truth bout my mom. About the selkies.\n\nThis year, she finally gets to meet her grandmother.\n\n[I can hardly wait.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)"],"title":"I’m glad my dad drowned"},{"content":["There is an old apothecary sheltered in an alleyway midtown. It is easy to miss if you do not know where to look. Its unassuming storefront is unmarked, and even if you find it there’s no guarantee the old Chinese proprietor will be there to have it open. He spends only a few days a month at the apothecary, if even that.     \n\nIf you can find it, and if you’re lucky enough to come on a day when he is there, he’ll welcome you inside. He is a wizened, wrinkled old creature. Stooped"," low and crooked, he stands scarcely taller than most peoples’ waists. Do not be surprised if he doesn’t ask what you want, but instead gives it to you with a knowing grin. This is because there is only one thing that people ever come to his apothecary for. They come for the mellified man.  \n\n*Sweet like honey. I am sweet like honey. For 14 days and 14 nights it is all I have consumed.*\n\nHe’ll hand you a small jar, labeled not in Chinese but Arabic letters. The following instructions"," will be with it, handwritten on a slip of paper that he’ll slide you through quivering, wrinkled fingers. “Apply directly to cuts, wounds, and fractures. Repeat every few hours. Ingest sparingly.”\n\n*I have quenched my thirst and sated my hunger with nothing but honey. Sweet and golden, it coats me inside and out. My sweat, my breath, even my feces is now sweet like honey.*  \n\nIngest sparingly. That is the most key thing to remember, and he’ll remind you of this before ushering"," you out. There is no need for payment, at least not yet, and he knows you will certainly return. After your first use, your first taste, of mellified man there is no doubt you will be back for more.  \n\n*It is all I will consume until the day comes that I too finally become honey.*  \n\nIt is a truly wondrous thing. Put it on a cut, a burn, even a scar and watch it fade and heal faster than you could’ve imagined. Eat it when you’re sick or feeling unwell and marvel at the energy"," and recovery that soon follows. With the many benefits of mellified man, it can be very easy to fall into the trap of habitually taking it. A pick-me-up at the end of the day, a boost of energy in the morning. There is no anxiety, or “comedown” or jitters. There is only the warmth, the sweetness, and the golden feeling of honey.  \n\n*I will be the mellified man. For 100 years or more I will steep in my jar of stone. In it I will dissolve, fully, turning from human flesh and blood"," into sticky, sweet and golden honey. They will remove me to treat the wounds and ailments of future generations. There will be no remnant of the man who was sealed in the jar a century ago. Only the honey.*  \n\nIn many ways, it is almost inevitable that you will fall into that trap. \n\n*And so I will live forever, undying, in the honey.* \n\nBefore long, you might realize that it tastes better, and leaves you feeling better, than eating normal food.  \n\n*Sweet like honey. I am sweet"," like honey.*  \n\nWith mellified man now a garnish on every meal, you’ll find that soon your jar is empty, and you’ll have to search out that old apothecary once more. This time it will be easier to find, and without fail the old man will always be there. It seems he knows, or is able to sense, your desire for more jars, for more mellified man.  \n\n*I will live forever, in the honey.*\n\nThe jars from the proprietor will, inevitably, start to last you a shorter and shorter amount of"," time. The small annoyances of life, a stubbed toe or a broken nail, are so easily solved! Headaches are a thing of the past, muscle tension is erased with a liberally applied dollop to the requisite region. Your visits will become more and more frequent to the apothecary, from monthly to fortnightly then every week. The old man will always be there to welcome you. He still will not ask for payment, insisting that he bestows the mellified man only out of a desire to heal. Seeing"," you glowing with such a golden radiance is payment enough, he will say, smiling as he hands you a new jar.  \n\n*I no longer can drink the honey by myself. They open my mouth to pour it through vast, endless sieves down my sticky-sweet throat. They bathe me in it, ladling its golden warmth over my inert form. They cut me to see how quickly from the wound my saccharine blood will flow. It never hurts anymore. The wound is always quickly sealed with the sweetness of honey.*\n\n“New”"," is a bit of misnomer when it comes to the jars. Each one is new to you, yes, but physically they are so old! Ancient stone cut by masons long ago in distant lands, there are tiny cracks forming along these pots that will grow sticky from the substance within. What a waste, you’ll surely think, as you see what little honey there is slowly seeping out, unused.  \n\n*Today my eyes became honey.*  \n\nYou’ll bring this concern up to the proprietor, rather sheepishly and trying not to"," offend. Thankfully, he readily agrees with you, telling you he’s noted the same thing. With that in mind he will make his way to the back of the shop, taking far longer than he usually does. When he returns it will be with a larger, taller, and truly newer jar. So tall, in fact, that it is nearly the size of you.  \n\n*They slowly dripped down my face, pooling in my open mouth.*  \n\nIt is the same shape as the others, and seemingly made of the same stone, but it looks and feels as"," if it was carved only the day before. Huffing and puffing the old man will set it down on the floor before you with an audible and weighty thud. He uncovers the lid to show you that it is filled to the brim with the sweetness you crave. No cracks, he’ll say grinning, and you know that finally none of it will go to waste.  \n\n*My eyes were sweet like honey. They were honey.*  \n\nHauling the jar back home would normally be an impossible task, but just a spoonful of the contents within"," is enough to give you the strength you need. This supply will last a year, you’ll think, and it certainly should.  \n\nBut it won’t, because with so much of the mellified man available to you, and with the confidence and painless life it gives, you’ll start to use it more and more. “Ingest sparingly” is a long forgotten concept, and why shouldn’t it be? You feel good, better than you have in all your life. You have plenty of mellified man to spare, and it makes quite literally everything"," better, everything you do more fun! Those first few months are always golden and sweet, and you won’t even notice how much your consumption is increasing. Or more likely you will simply choose not to.  \n\n*Sweet like honey, they were sweet like honey.*  \n\nAs time goes on, and as the jar’s contents considerably thin, the sweetness of those first few months will start to fade. There will be an anxiety as you notice that what should’ve lasted a year appears to be more than half-way"," gone already. This anxiety, you will find, can only be quenched by taking more of the mellified man, and in doing so exacerbating the problem.  \n\n*I will live forever in the honey.*  \n\nYou likely won’t want to go back to the apothecary so soon, but you’ll know you must. You’ll make your way there, seeking it out as you have so many times before.\n\nBut strangely, this time the store will seem as impossible, difficult, and convoluted to find as it was on your first visit. Even if"," you do find it, you’ll discover, to your shock, that for the first time since you’ve become a regular visitor the old proprietor isn’t there.  \n\n*They lifted what remained of me today in their arms and carried me to my jar. I could not see or hear them, my ears having long ago turned to honey, but what remained of my flesh felt them take me from my bath. Sweet and golden rivulets fell down me, slowly, bringing with them the last bits of my skin. The shaking of their arms tells"," me they are afraid. Perhaps they are thinking of the day they too, will become honey.*  \n\nEvery time you try it’s the same story. The apothecary’s location either eludes you, or the old man isn’t there to let you in. Each time you’ll return home, desolate, fretting, and in need of what mellified man your rapidly depleting stores can afford you.  \n\n*I am set in the jar, and it is filled with honey.*  \n\nSlowly over time, although it may feel quick to you, that seemingly vast and"," bottomless jar will come down to its last dregs.\n\n*It covers what is left of my face, fills the holes and orifices where my nose, eyes, and mouth once were.*  \n\nA small pool in the bottom, and what coats the sides of the jar’s interior will be all that remains.  \n\n*It is so very sweet. Sweet like me. Sweet like honey.*  \n\nUnable to find the apothecary, you might try to resist, quit, or cut yourself off from taking any more. As a result, headaches, nerves, and all the other daily"," painful occurrences of life that you’d forgotten will return with a vengeance like never before. Even the most minor inconveniences will feel overwhelming without your daily dose of mellified man.  \n\n*I am sweet like honey. I live forever in the honey.*  \n\nAnd so you’ll find yourself, bending over, stretching your arms and craning your body on tiptoes to reach that last sweet, meager pool at the bottom of the jar. Inevitably it will be just out of your reach. You’ll stretch further"," and further, leaning more and more over the brim until, equally inevitably, you fall in.  \n\n*Join me in the honey.*  \n\nIf you’re fortunate enough to not break something with your sudden fall onto unforgiving stone, you’ll try to clamber your way out of the jar. You’ll scramble and squirm about in the tight, sticky confines, only to find that you can’t get any sort of grip or purchase on the walls. Desperately you will writhe, only becoming more and more entrapped within. Honey"," will begin to coat your face, your eyes, your mouth, your nose.  \n\n*Live forever in the honey.*\n\nIt is there, in that vast jar of mellified man, that the old proprietor will eventually come to collect you. If you are lucky, enough time will have passed that your mind will be too far gone to realize what is happening. If you aren’t, you will feel it as you are slowly surrounded by the honey. He will pour it over you in a vast, endlessly sweet cascade. It will rise around you, enveloping"," you in its golden, cocooning warmth. You will hear a final, dreadful and deafening grating of stone on stone as the proprietor seals you within. There you will remain.  \n\n*I am the mellified man. In a 100 years or more you will take me from my jar and there I still will be.

I couldn’t see exactly what it was but I had a sinister feeling about it.* \n\nMy mind then took me out of the shed, pulling away as if my field of vision was a camera on a track going backwards out of the space like in a movie. In a swift flash I was off of her property and on a country road I recognized. \n\nI had driven by this woman’s house before. It was a worn out rambler on the road behind the local grange. \n\n*I"," could be there in less than 10 minutes.* \n\nI got there in maybe four minutes, racing up the wet road. \n\nI rushed into the woman’s shed and found her standing on a stool, the noose in her hand. \n\nHer name was Linda. She was a widow who never had children. \n\nWe talked. She promised me she wouldn’t think about doing what she was going to do again. She wasn’t actually going to do it anyways. \n\n*I didn’t believe her.* \n\nYou’re probably wondering where this newfound condition came to"," me from. It was a simple answer to me. \n\nI had just moved into a new rental house and on one end of the property was a cemetery. I swore it even had an underground power line that ran through it. I felt I had some odd new energy coursing through me ever since I had moved in there. \n\nThe premonitions felt like a dreadful curse at first. I would start to get a nauseous feeling in my stomach wherever they would come. I tried to fight them. \n\nThen I realized I could kind of become"," a real life, small town superhero, and I started to embrace them. \n\nI would sit at home, waiting for something to come to me, hoping I would get to help someone that night. \n\nI saved a child from drowning. I put out a house fire before the sleeping family even knew their stove was about to burn down their home. I found a young boy who was lost in the woods and going to freeze to death. \n\nA few of the stories of my heroism ended up getting back to the TV stations down in Seattle"," and it was eventually connected that some 41-year-old single guy who worked at a chain hardware store had saved multiple people in separate incidents. \n\nThe TV reporters were dogged. They stayed on me until I caved and allowed one of them to do some kind of puff piece about me being a guardian angel. \n\nI did an interview high as fuck. But whatever, they aired it and paid me $200. \n\nI knew I shouldn’t have done it. \n\n**She came to my door that night around midnight.** \n\nThe ringing"," of the doorbell woke me up. I grabbed the flashlight taser I kept by my bed and crept to the front door. \n\nI tucked the taser light away once I saw her standing there on my dark front porch, her long black hair half in her pale face. Her body was thin and lithe - cased in a long, black dress. She appeared harmless. \n\nI opened the door and she just stared at me for a few seconds like she was trying to confirm who I was by studying my face. Silent all the while. \n\n“Can I help you?”"," I asked. \n\nShe walked away without saying a word. \n\nI was so stunned I didn’t get a word out until she was almost in her car. She just ignored my plea for her to come back and drove away into the night. \n\nThe visit told me to stop what I was doing. Stop helping. Don’t respond to the visions. \n\nThe next night I was presented with the vision of a middle-aged man. Wedding ring. The kind of guy who looked like a dad. He got hit by an unexpected snow storm while hiking in the mountains"," and was lost. \n\nWhat he didn’t know was he was just 20 yards away from the parking lot and the safety of his truck, but he couldn’t see it through the snow, and he was too tired, and cold, to make it at this point. \n\n*I could be up at that parking lot in less than 30 minutes. I could save him.* \n\nBut I wouldn’t. Something told me not to do it. Just as something was sending these messages to be the hero, something was now creeping into the back of my head, telling me it would not"," end well for me, and not because of the snow. I had to stop interfering. \n\nI took down a few drinks, hoping getting drunk might block out the messages of this poor man’s fading fate. \n\nIt didn’t work. I kept getting visions of that man lost up in the snow. He was now struggling to move. *He wasn’t going to be able to keep it going much longer.* \n\nUnless I went up there and helped him. \n\nI couldn’t watch a man die in the movie theater in my head. I jumped in my truck and drove"," up into the mountains. \n\nThe snow was falling hard when I got to the parking lot. I had visions the entire way of where the man was. I knew he wasn’t far from the lot and was now crawling through the snow wasting away the last few minutes of his life. \n\nI trudged through the snow in the direction where I was sure he was. \n\nI came across someone dressed in all black first. They were standing over something on the ground, nearly buried in the snow. \n\nIt was the woman who showed"," up on my doorstep that night. She crouched down and held onto whatever was on the ground below her. \n\nI held myself there and watched what she was doing. Her hand was on the chest of the man on the ground. \n\nVisions flashed into me. I was in the P.O.V. of the man on the ground in the snow, looking upward at the face of the woman in black - her pupils wide and black, her skin ashen white, and her hand strong on my chest, feeling like it was pushing me down into the ground. \n\nShe"," was taking away the man’s life at that very moment. I could feel the man go still. \n\nThen the woman in black turned around to me. I started to backpedal towards my truck. \n\nShe didn’t say anything, just moved quickly towards me. I could feel a powerful anger rushing at me. It seeped into my muscles and made movement difficult. I was suddenly slow in my retreat back to my truck. \n\nShe was not slow. She moved swiftly to me and soon was almost within arm’s reach of me. \n\nMy vision"," started to move away from the dead dad over in the snow and to myself. I could now see myself lying on the ground next to my truck, with the woman in black on top of me, her hand pushed hard onto my chest, draining the life out of me. \n\nI think she was sending me a warning more than anything though. I didn’t think she actually wanted to kill me. It was like she was telepathically telling me it wasn’t my time. She played by the rules, but she was willing to bend them if I didn’t"," stop. \n\n*I would have to stop.* I opened my mouth and told her that. \n\nShe seemed to accept it. She walked away into the endless white of the snow and I got in my truck and drove back home. \n\n\\-\n\n*Now I’m cursed.* \n\nI sit at home every night knowing who is going to die in my vicinity, and how they are going to die, and knowing I could do something about it, but won’t.\n\nI drink more than I used to and sometimes when I’ve had too much, *which is almost every night*, I think about"," getting into my truck, and going to save someone for whom I am their only hope for survival. \n\n*Maybe I will someday.* "],"title":"I Suddenly Can See How People in My Town Are Going To Die Right Before They Do, But I Can Save Them"},{"content":["**Slam** \n\n\nI spun around sharply and saw that the heavy freezer door was firmly shut. My colleague, Logan, was holding the door handle, with no discernible expression on his face. \n\n\n\"That better not be locked\", I said to him sternly. \n\n\n\"Of course it's not locked. It's never locked\", he replied in a tone that seemed to imply I was being stupid for even thinking that it was. \n\n\n\"Oh yeah? Open it then\", I shot back at him.\n\n\nLogan tugged on the freezer door handle, and the door"," didn't budge. It's movement was clearly prevented by the fact that it was definitely locked. \n\n\n\"Fuck\", he said, almost surprised he was wrong.\n\n\n\"Yeah, fuck is right! I think you are now a shoe-in for that promotion. I heard they are looking for managers who lock themselves in the freezer\", I angrily replied to him. \n\n\n\"Don't worry, that job is still mine\", he retorted.\n\n\nLogan and I were currently rivals, fighting over the management position in the supermarket. I should've"," been convinced that I now had the job in the bag, especially after this blunder. Logan, though, was quite tenacious, and would probably still try anything to get that job. \n\n\n\"And, by the way\", he continued, \"There is enough air in a standard walk-in freezer to last 24 hours, so we should be fine\".\n\n\n\"I think the cold might be a slightly more pressing matter\", I replied, almost condescendingly. \n\n\nThat was the other thing about Logan. He knew lots of random trivia facts, and he"," was more than happy to provide you with one, even if the timing wasn't always appropriate. \n\n\n\"Well what do we do now?\", I asked, as the realisation of the severity of our predicament set in. \n\n\nI glanced up at the wall as I spoke, and read the electronic temperature gauge that was attached to it. It read '-9 degrees'.\n\n\n \"There is an emergency button in here somewhere. It sets off an alarm inside the store\", Logan said excitedly, as he remembered that this button existed. \n\n\n\"Oh"," great! We are saved. It will let everyone know we are in here\", I said with fake enthusiasm, \"Oh wait… we are working the graveyard shift and are the only employee's here\". \n\n\n\"Well someone will come in eventually. I think it's only a few hours before shift change. I think we will be okay until then\", he responded with, what I thought to be, a false sense of hope. \n\n\nLogan reached up and pressed the button, and as he did, I heard a faint alarm bell ringing from the shopfloor."," The sound of ringing that would determine whether or not we would be freed from our icy prison. \n\n\nThere really wasn't much else we could do though. We both left our phones in the office when we started our shift, and so we were trapped here until someone heard the alarm.\n\n\nLuckily, we were both wearing thick woolen coats and gloves. They would help preserve our heat, and could mean survival in the cold conditions for just a while longer. \n\n\nI watched as the breath I exhaled turned"," to a fine mist in front of me, and I could see the fine layer of ice that covered everything inside the freezer. The only thing I didn't experience was the cold itself. In fact, I felt slightly warm. Somehow, in this below zero freezer, I was a little bit hot. \n\n\n\"Hey, wanna hear a fun fact\"?, Logan said from the other end of the freezer.\n\n\n\"Sure\", I said, partly because I knew he was going to tell me anyway, and partly because I needed a distraction. \n\n\n\"Well, did you know that"," Ostriches have three stomachs?'' he asked.\n\n\n\"No, I didn't know that. Thanks for enlightening me\".\n\n\n\"If you liked that fact, you will love this\", he said, and then continued to speak before I could object, \"There is a parasite that inhabits the Stickleback fish, and once infected, the parasite affects the fishes the behaviour so that they are more careless and are easier prey for birds. The bird then eats the fish, and the parasite infects the bird\".\n\n\nI listened to him speak,"," confused as to why he was telling me these random facts. I was beginning to become distracted though, as I was really beginning to feel warm.\n\n\n \"Oh, and have you heard that certain drugs, like LSD, raise your body temperature. There you go, another fun fact for you. Bet you didn't kn- hey what are you doing?\"\n\n\nLogan changed what he was saying because he saw me stand up and take off the large woolen coat that was protecting me from the cold. I suddenly felt really warm and needed"," to shed the extra layers. I felt an instant rush of relief when the coat had been relieved, as I felt my temperature drop to a more appropriate level.\n\n\n\"What are you doing? You really are going to freeze if you take that off?\", Logan said, sounding concerned for my well being. \n\n\n\"Don't ask me how, but I felt hot\", I replied. \n\n\n\"Hot? You're crazy\". \n\n\nI was about to respond by asking him to feel my arm to see if it felt warm or it was just in my head, when I looked down at my"," arm and saw a small hole. I studied it closer. There was a rather tiny hole in the crease of my elbow, in the same spot they usually draw blood from. In fact, I think this is what it was. It looked as if the hole was caused by a needle. \n\n\n\"Do you see this?\", I called out to Logan, as I outstretched my arm, \"That small hole right there\"?\n\n\nLogan took a step towards me, inspected my arm for a minute and then nodded.\n\n\n\"Yeah, looks like you've had a blood test\", he said, \"And speaking"," of blood, did you know that a pint of blood contains 2.4 trillion red blood cells\".\n\n\n\"I haven't had a blood test\", I told him, ignoring his useless fact. \n\n\nAnd that is when it dawned on me. I had no recollection of entering the freezer. All I remembered was that I was throwing away some rotten meat that had small maggots in it, and the next, Logan was closing the freezer door. The rest of my memory was a total blank. I suddenly knew what happened. \n\n\n\"You drugged me!\", I said"," to Logan accusingly. \n\n\n\"I'm sorry? What?\"\n\n\n\"Yeah. Yeah, it makes sense. You drugged me, then locked us in the freezer. Then, when we get rescued, you can blame it on me and insist they drug test me. Or…no… surely not…\"\n\n\nA dark thought crept into my head. I knew Logan would do pretty much anything for this promotion, but surely not this. \n\n\n\"You were going to leave me to die in here. You will be rescued, and you will claim you tried to save me, but you couldn't. Then, your competition"," is out of the way, and the promotion is yours\". \n\n\nLogan stared at me in confusion and disbelief. Maybe disbelief at what I was saying, or disbelief that I had worked out his insidious plan. \n\n\n\"You're paranoid\", he replied after a moment, \"I didn't drug you. What the fuck are you on about. Someone will hear the alarm soon and we will be saved. We will both be out of here soon\".\n\n\nI looked at him, trying to figure out if he was telling the truth, or if I was correct.\n\n\n\"Then why"," did you tell me that fact about the drug that raises your body temperature? Why did that fact pop into your head?\", I yelled at him, realising that more and more pieces were starting to connect.\n\n\n\"Because that's what I do. I tell random facts. I don't know why I told you that one. It's just something I thought of\", he spat back at me.\n\n\nI watched him intently, and I could see his anger level rising. I noticed this because I saw a few veins in his neck begin to stick out. My eye"," was drawn to the rather large vein that was now poking out his neck. The vein then wriggled.\n\n\nI jumped backwards. \n\n\n\"What the fuck was that\"?, I yelled, \"Your vein just moved\". \n\n\nAs I spoke, I saw the vein wriggle once more. It looked like it was a small, blue snake that slithered slightly along Logan's neck. I took in a few deep breaths and tried to rationalise the situation, and I quickly found an explanation.\n\n\n\"I'm hallucinating aren't I? Whatever you gave me is making"," me see some weird shit\".\n\n\nLogan just looked at me like I was losing my mind, which was entirely possible. \n\n\nThen, I felt a strange wiggling sensation down my own arm. I moved my focus towards it and saw two of my own veins wriggle just below the surface of my skin. I felt them move too. Whatever drug Logan injected me with, it was really beginning to take effect. \n\n\nI watched both my arms as the veins inside them moved around, like small worms in the dirt. I felt each movement,"," but I had to keep reminding myself it was just the effect of some hallucinogen. \n\n\nThen, breaking my concentration from my arms, I felt my nose start to run. This made my brain realise that I was still stuck inside the freezer and that the cold would be a danger to me. \n\n\nI sniffed and felt whatever was running out my nose return to where it came from. The fear inside me grew. I was stuck in freezing temperatures, drugged, and now hallucinating as well. I didn't have much hope"," that I would survive the night. And Logan was to blame. \n\n\nI looked up at him, and saw the worried expression on his face, but lunged towards him anyway. I refused to die without a fight. I grabbed Logan by the arm and was just about to push him forwards, when I felt his vein slither below the palm of my hand. \n\n\nI recoiled and let go of him. His face now showed signs of pure terror. I looked at his face for a moment, when I saw the thing slide out of one of his nostrils. The"," long, pure white worm was about a foot long and it slid out the end of his nose and dropped towards the ground. \n\n\nI screamed at the same time that Logan did. He opened his mouth and let out a loud, ear piercing scream, and as he did, another worm slithered out of his mouth. \n\n\nMy nose started to run again, but I didn't have time to sniff it back up. The long, ghostly pale worm crawled out of my nostril and fell to the ground. Whatever these things were, they were inside me too. \n\n\nI"," was too scared to even scream, as I looked back down at my arms and saw all of the wriggling. I now knew exactly what they were, and they weren't my veins. \n\n\nI felt more and more of the worms begin to slide out of my nose, and a couple out of my mouth. I looked to Logan and saw that the same thing was happening to him too. \n\n\n**Click** \n\n\nThe freezer door slid open, and I saw a puzzled looking customer staring at us. His face changed from one of confusion to pure fear as he saw"," what was happeing to the both of us. \n\n\nThe last thing I saw before I blacked out was a large group of the parasitic worms all crawled and slithering towards the terryfied man. \n\n\nThis was just over a week ago now, and I am still recovering from what happened. There are small holes covering almost my entire body, created by the things escaping. \n\n\nI haven't seen Logan since the incident, but I'm told by the doctors that he survived and ended up with similar injuries to me. \n\n\nMy"," mind keeps wandering back to the fact that Logan told me. \n\n\nThe parasite first infects. It then influences the behaviour of its host, in this case, influencing its host to move somewhere that was ideal for it to grow and multiply. The parasite then moves on to infect others. "],"title":"A colleague and I got trapped inside a walk-in freezer.

Someone else was lying in plaster, covered in sores and bruises. This couldn’t be my little girl. This wasn’t Daphne.\n\nFinally, my daughter spoke. Her words, like a switchblade knife, spilled my guts and entrails across the floor. A part of me died right then and there.\nAs our eyes met, something coursed"," through me. Something evil. She grimaced as she spoke. Her voice as empty as a blue sky.\n\n“Who the hell are you?”\n\n…\n\nThe nurses had to drag me away, kicking and screaming. They even called security. Something came over me. I was devastated. Looking for quick answers.  But it was all I could think to do. Throwing a tantrum helped take my mind off of what was troubling me: that girl lying on the hospital bed was not my daughter.\n\nThe worst part: I’m to blame. \n\nIt was my idea to"," give Daphne the sparkling new sports car on her seventeenth birthday. Big mistake. Or maybe, the mistake was letting her drive in a storm. But what can a parent do? She’s basically an adult. I had to let her go.\n\nI tell myself this every day, hoping it’ll help. \n\nIt doesn’t. \n\n…\n\nAs much as I was concerned about my daughter, I was also concerned about my wife. Tara was falling apart. She spent the night tossing and turning, saying strange things under her breath, while I buried"," my head beneath the pillow and wished for death. \n\nSleep was impossible, so I sneaked off to search up articles regarding amnesia, and it’s affects on families. I didn’t like what I learned. There was a chance her memory may never return. I prayed this wasn't the case, and that it was only temporary. By the end of summer, my daughter would be her feisty self again.  \n\nThe following morning, I drove us to the hospital. The day was humid and gross. It was going to be a scorcher."," The journey to the hospital was as miserable as the previous night. Since we were no longer on speaking terms, my mind was off to the races. I couldn’t get those dark, insidious eyes from my mind. Whose were they? They certainly didn’t belong to my precious daughter. \t\n\nAnd what about her words: “Who the hell are you?”\n\nSince when does she cuss? \n\nHopefully today would be different. Maybe today she would remember me.\n\nWe came bearing gifts; a bouquet of flowers, some tasty treats,"," plus Daphne’s favorite stuffed animal: a beat-to-death donkey her grandmother gave her on her first birthday. The room seemed smaller than the previous night, and less significant. The air was thick; the temperature hot enough to boil water. \n\nDaphne was in bed, staring at the ceiling. She turned onto her side, away from us. This took great effort, seeing as how she was wrapped in plaster.\n\n“Hi Hon,” I said shakily, placing the stuffed animal on her bedside table. \n\nShe grunted.\n\nMy"," wife pushed past me, and offered her the flowers. They certainly improved the smell of the room. A disturbing odour was permeating from Daphne. The smell of rotting flesh. I made a note to mention this to the nurse. \n\nTara attempted small talk, which couldn’t have been easy. Things had already been strenuous between them lately, without this. You know how it can be with a teenage girl and her mother. I chalked it up to teenage insolence. My sister and mother were the same. She"," placed the flowers next to the toy donkey, and asked how she was feeling, then stood there limply, waiting for a response that never came. \n\nDaphne grunted. \n\nThe next five minutes took forever. Nobody spoke. Then a nurse came to check on Daphne, saving us from further awkwardness. The look on this young woman’s face did nothing to ease my nerves. It was a look of fear. She asked how Daphne was feeling; Daphne grunted. Those grunts were gnawing on my nerves. She sounded like a"," dog.\n\nShe’s injured, I reminded myself. Show some compassion. Before I could consider this, a voice in my head interfered with my better judgement:\n\n“You’re to blame, Chuck. This is all your fault.”\n\nI hated the Voice. It’s gruff chainsaw-like tone, cutting me down branch by branch. \n\nAs the nurse was finishing up with Daphne, my wife and I edged closer. The rotten stench was impossible to ignore. I kicked myself for not asking about it. Except, what would I ask? Why does my nearly-dead"," daughter stink to high heaven? Not happening. Not today, anyway. Best play it cool, let the experts do their thing.\n\nDaphne was glaring at her mother. So much so, that my wife looked away, fumbling through her purse unconsciously. The pure, unadulterated hatred spewing from my daughter’s eyes was sickening. \n\nI spoke up.\n\n“How are you feeling, Daph?”\n\nNo response.\n\n“You look well, under the circumstances.” \n\nNo response.\n\n“Look,” I said, finding an ounce of bravado. “You’ve been"," through a lot. And your memory is all jarred up. But things will work themselves out. I promise.” \n\nBut did I really mean this? \n\n“Besides,” I added, hoping to sound cheery. “You’re lucky to be alive. You had us worried.”\n\nDaphne’s face twitched. Her lips curled. Her eyes never leaving her mother’s.\n\n“Fuck off.”\n\nI collapsed onto the dilapidated chair, reeling in those ugly words. She’d never spoke to me like that; nor to anyone, as far as I knew. Daphne was a good girl.\n\nMy wife’s"," eyebrows slanted. “Now, now, Daph, don’t speak to…”\n\n“Shut up, bitch.”\n\nMy wife recoiled. She moved next to me, tears spilling down her makeup-free face. She looked defeated. Something inside her died. If I’d known what was to come, I would’ve tried harder to comfort her. But how was I to know? Besides, I was hurting too. \n\nI flicked on the small TV attached to the wall, looking for diversion. A sleazy game show host greeted us boorishly. \n\nDaphne disapproved.\n\n“Turn that noise"," box off!” \n\nShe made a gargoyle face. It’s terrible to say this, but it was true. More and more, I began to suspect the worst. This wasn’t my daughter. Something happened. Something sinister. The rational part of me disagreed. She’s injured. This is part of the healing process. It was too soon to tell. \n\nWithout warning, my wife grabbed my arm and forced me to the washroom. Instead of speaking, she mouthed, “Our daughter isn’t right.”\n\n“I can hear you,” Daphne mocked. Her voice"," like a lawnmower. \n\nImpossible. We were on the opposite end of the room. The TV game show host announced the next contestant on Let’s Make a Deal with the Devil. I didn’t trust his voice any more than my own daughter’s. \n\nI turned off the TV. The silence was deafening. Daphne’s breathing became unbearable. It sounded like a motorboat passing through tiny nostrils. Now facing her, I started to say something cute, but she cut me off.\n\n“GO AWAY.” \n\nHer voice was colder than the month"," of February. Her icy words chilled me to the bone. Again, I fell to my chair, almost destroying my tailbone in the process. They really need better chairs in this hospital.\n\nTara spoke up. “Don’t you talk that…”\n\n“GET OUT.”\n\nMy wife crumbled. She literally fell to the floor. Her body hit the linoleum like a marionette released from its strings. Just then, another nurse entered the room. An older black lady looking as tough as Chuck Norris. A momentary glimpse of relief filled"," me. Maybe she had answers.\n\nThe nurse pulled my wife and I out of the room. The look on her heavyset face was foreboding. \n\n“Look,” she said. “Your daughter’s been though a lot in the last twenty-four hours. She’s suffering from amnesia. This affects people differently. She’s confused. And needs people to blame. Also, she’s in a lot of pain. She nearly died, you know.”\n\nShe leaned in close enough so that I could smell her shampoo. It smelled like strawberry-kiwi.\n\n“After you left"," last night, she threw a fit. It was quite the scene, let me tell ya. One nurse quit. Stormed straight out of here.”\n\nI was forming a response; the nurse waved her meaty hand, ordering me to hush.  \n\n“It gets worse.” She whispered, “I wish I didn’t have to say this. But something tells me I should: That nurse killed herself. Gunshot to the head did the trick.”\n\nHer eyes moistened. “I don’t think this has anything to do with your daughter, of course. But you know. It makes no sense."," Tamara was happy. Something triggered her do it. Something bad. Anyway, not sure why I’m telling you this. Just be careful.” \n\nShe wiped the corner of her eyes, then forced a smile. “Anyways, things should improve with time. They usually do. We’re keeping close eye on your daughter. You should too.” \n\nHer eyes added one final detail: Your life may depend upon it. \n\nWith that, we re-entered the hospital room. Daphne was staring at the ceiling, not blinking. I approached with caution."," The smell of death was getting stronger with every step. Once I reached the bed, I leaned in to kiss her forehead. \n\n“Don’t you dare,” she snapped. \n\nI kissed her anyway. \n\nI wish I hadn’t.\n\nThe moment my lips touched her skin, a sharp pain surged through my entire body. My lips were electrocuted. I winced. \n\nThe nurse came rushing over, folded her arms. She towered over Daphne as a principal does during detention. This is a woman I would not want to cross. \nMy wife tore out of"," the room, beelining it to the elevator. I shot the nurse a quick glance, said goodbye to Daphne, then went after her. \n\nMy wife was waiting at the elevator. The door opened. I almost knocked over some poor kid on crutches, just to make it on time.\n\nMy wife snarled. She grabbed my hand and squeezed until it hurt.\n\n“This is your fault, Chuck.” \n\nFor a scary moment, I was unable to decipher who said this. Was it my wife, or the Voice?\n\nThere were no tears left inside me. I took this"," on the chin. She was grieving, I had to cut her some slack. For me, the only cure was a six pack of cold beer and the Red Sox game on TV. You see, at this point, I had a shred of optimism. Like the nurse said, my daughter was sick. She’s in shock. Things will improve. Slowly but surely.\n\n…\n\nWhile drinking beer, throwing popcorn at the TV when necessary, Tara cleaned the entire house, top to bottom, mumbling to herself the entire time. \n\n“His fault. This is his fault. Not mine."," His fault. He’s to blame. Not me.”\n\nSmartly, I said nothing. We all have different coping mechanisms. This was hers. Besides, she was correct. This was my fault. I was to blame.\n\nTara slept in Daphne’s room. This was a bad idea, and we both knew it. But once her mind is set, there’s no changing it. \n\nI slept alone with my thoughts. It wasn't long before the Voice had completely taken over, never letting me catch a wink: \n\n“Your fault Chuck. You and only you. Nobody else is to"," blame. You did this. You destroyed your daughter.”\n\nAt some point, when the rays of sunshine sprinkled into the wilting bedroom, I picked myself up out of bed and forced myself to the bathroom. I showered. \n\nThe water was my salvation. I closed my eyes and surrendered to it. Something was wrong. The water was thick and gooey, like having warm gravy poured over you. My eyes opened. Blood was shooting out the shower head, covering me top to bottom, like a slaughtered pig. I shrieked."," The crimson-colored bar of soap fell through my fingers, and slid down the drain. My legs gave out.\n\nThis is just my over-tired imagination. I’m exhausted, that’s all. \n\nI blinked, and the blood disappeared. Just water.\n\nMy daughter was doing this. \n\nI hated myself for thinking this. Another thought arrived as fast and furious as the first one:\n\nOr maybe it was the Voice.\n\n…\n\nThe wife stayed home. She’d made a long list of chores that couldn’t wait, including talking to the police,"," who wanted to know everything about my daughter’s birthday party, including who her friends were, and what – if any – substances were consumed. \n\nThe drive to the hospital was fruitless. Rain drowned the streets like sewer rats. Meanwhile, the Voice raged on.\n\n“You’re a bad father, Chuck. Everyone knows this to be true.”\n\nThe same tired-looked receptionist greeted me. She looked like she hadn’t slept either. The elevator trip was abhorrent; the people inside recoiled at the sight"," of me, as though my misery was contagious. Maybe it was. All bets were off by this point. If only the Voice would shut up, or at least take a break. \n\nIt didn’t.\n\n“She despises you, Chuck. Your own flesh and blood. And it's your fault.”\n\n“SHUT UP!” I cried, unsure if I’d spoken aloud.\n\nThe elevator shuddered. A young man in a wheelchair huffed, then wheeled away as soon as the door sprung open, shaking his head the entire time.\n\nI looked at my shoes in embarrassment. \n\n“Everyone"," knows you did this, Chuck,” the Voice chimed.\n\n“Shut up,” I whispered. \n\nDefeat had my on the ropes. I was barely keeping it together. When the elevator dinged, I tripped as I was leaving. The long hospital hall loomed sullenly. I was reminded of The Shining. The strange patterns on the floor, twisting and turning like a drunkard’s walk home. The walls were the color of yellow, when white turns filthy. I kept my head down, avoiding eye contact.\n\nSomeone pushed past me.\n\n“Um, sorry"," Mr. Draper.”  \n\nBryce was ghost white. His eyes bulging to his knees. As I turned to talk, he bolted.\n\n“Hey!” I shouted.\n\nAll I saw was Bryce’s backside, as he raced towards the elevator. He stabbed the orange button repeatedly, shifting from leg to leg.\n\n“Bryce,” I called out. \n\nA million questions surfaced in my mind. Without realizing it, I was heading towards him. As I grew nearer, the elevator beeped. I made it just as the elevator door closed. Before it shut, his troubled"," eyes found mine. \n\n\"She’s somebody else.\"\n\nThe elevator closed. Bryce disappeared. \n\nI stood at the door, scratching my head. Hearing him utter those words was deeply disturbing. Why was he so shook up? Suddenly, I didn’t want to see my daughter. This thought nearly killed me. It took every ounce of strength to march toward her hospital room.\n\nOur rendezvous was brief. She told me to jump off a tall building. \n\nI left the hospital feeling worse than ever. Bryce’s words were dangling"," like a noose on a dule tree: \n\n“She’s somebody else.\" \n\nThe rest of the day was spend arguing with my deteriorating wife. Things between us were at an all-time low. I was afraid she might hurt herself, or me. She was angry all the time. This will be a tough week, I reminded myself, as she gathered her things to spend another night in Daphne’s room. I watched her shadow disappear under the dying glow of the hallway, and heard the door creak as it closed. \n\nThe next day was no better."," \n\nBryce was found dead. Suicide.

I Think She’s Turning Evil."},{"content":["  \n\nI rented a beautiful home in the foothills of West Virginia. I needed some time away from the hustle and bustle. This place was amazing. It was like someone had plopped a beach house down in the middle of the woods. I didn’t need a place this big for myself but I couldn’t pass up the amazing price for a weekly rental. When I asked the woman why this beautiful home was so cheap, she smiled nervously and said, “Just that time of year.”\n\nI didn’t question her any further for fear"," she would realize her mistake and up the price. \n\nThe day I arrived was mostly sunny with a few clouds lazily drifting by. Just enough to give some ambiance to the scenery. It was on a wildlife preserve, so animals lingered in the field without a care in the world. I saw deer and turkey walk right up to my car as I drove down the dirt road towards my destination.\n\nWhen I pulled in I thought I had arrived in heaven. There was a lake right next to the house with fields and woods"," all around. A fire pit was set up beside the lake with a ring of wooden chairs encircling it. As I parked my car and got my suitcase a deer walked right up to me and sniffed me. I held out my hand and she (I assumed it was a she because it had no antlers) regarded me for a moment before sticking her nose in my palm and taking a deep breath. She eyed me once more then slowly walked off as if she had said hello to a neighbor and was off on her way. \n\nI typed in the security code"," and went inside. The pictures didn’t do this house justice. My jaw dropped and I dragged it around looking at all the rooms. There was a full game room with a pool table, card table, foosball, air hockey, giant TV, you name it. The place had a hot tub, and a half dozen decks surrounding it. You could step out and see in any direction from a bird’s eye view. There were rocking chairs all around, which I fully intended to take advantage of.\n\nThe entire place was set up for comfort"," and ease. I put my suitcase in the master bedroom then brought the rest of my supplies in, which consisted of a lot of food. I had no idea how far the stores were from the house and I didn’t want to waste hours of my day looking for a grocery store when I could be relaxing. \n\nOnce I had put my food away I looked around for the wifi password. It was posted on a bulletin board in the kitchen, along with some other instructions. \n\n‘This is our home, please take care of it as you"," would your own.’ ‘The dishes and silverware are here for your use, please make sure they don’t ‘accidentally’ visit your house.’ \n\nI chuckled at these little reminders. ‘Please don’t flush anything but toilet paper.’\n\nThen I paused as I read an unusual one. \n\n‘When you retire for the evening, make sure you close and lock all windows, doors, blinds, and curtains. Do not open them or go out on the deck for any reason until sunup. If you wish to stargaze, do so only on Wednesday"," night.’\n\nThis struck me as rather odd. I had no intention of doing any of this of course. Once I go to bed I’m out until morning. \n\nI settled in and made myself some supper. I took it outside and sat in a rocking chair that overlooked the lake. I watched the sunset mirroring itself in the water before disappearing. Shortly after the clouds lit up a brilliant red at twilight. I never wanted to leave this place.\n\nOnce the post dusk insects came in I decided to adjourn back inside"," and read a book. I perused their selection, which ranged all over. From the standard paperbacks of John Grisham and Lee Child to cookbooks to history books. There were also a few more esoteric choices, such as ‘Strange creatures of the wilderness' and ‘Haunted West Virginia’. I decided on a Clive Cussler book and took it with me to bed. \n\nA few chapters in I felt sleep tugging at my eyelids so I laid the book aside and snuggled in. \n\nIt seemed like ten seconds later the morning"," sun was peeking in through a sliver in the blinds telling me it was time to get up. I made some coffee and a bagel, then went back out to greet my lake. It had been raining and that fresh smell lingered in the air. The feeling of renewal surrounded me. I wanted to stay here for the rest of my life.\n\nI milled around the house that day, taking some incredible wildlife pictures. I read some more of my book and pretty much enjoyed relaxing. When I went to bed that evening I made sure"," the doors were locked and the blinds closed, as instructed. \n\nThe next day went pretty much the same. I decided to do some stargazing that evening but it was overcast and the stars only peeked out here and there. I went to bed disappointed for the first time this week. \n\nThe following night I went to bed early with the intention of getting up in the middle of the night and looking for the missing stars from the night before. At midnight the alarm on my phone woke me. I peeked"," out through the curtain and saw a sky full of stars with nary a cloud in sight. Excited, I grabbed my camera and tripod, then headed out onto the deck. \n\nThe air was crisp but not cold. I got my camera set up on the tripod and started taking pictures of the stars. As the camera did its thing my eyes drifted toward the lake. It was a moonless night and there was little light but as my eyes adjusted I swore I saw someone sitting in one of the chairs near the lake. \n\nAs I looked"," more intently, I saw more than one somebody. It appeared that each chair was occupied. I wondered if some local kids were borrowing my fire ring for a party, not realizing I had rented the place for the week. My ire rose as I began to mentally compose the email I would send to the owner informing her of the intrusion when my mind froze.\n\nNone of them were wearing clothes.\n\nI know when I see a naked person. Admittedly that hasn’t been nearly as often as I’d like lately, but I know"," the look. These people didn’t look like that. They were tall, dark, and looked like every one of them needed a full-body shave.\n\nThen it hit me. They weren’t human.\n\nMy curiosity and fear raged a mighty battle but in the end, curiosity won. I slowly adjusted my camera from aiming at the sky to aiming at the chairs surrounding the fire pit. I had just snapped the first picture when one of the creatures noticed me. It growled something to the rest and they all turned and stared"," at me.\n\nI’ve never felt such a shard of pure terror penetrate my mind as I did at that moment. \n\nI grabbed my camera and darted inside. Once there I made sure to lock the door. \n\nIt wasn’t ten seconds until the assault began. The pounding on the doors and windows was nothing in comparison to the guttural growling and screaming.  I was terrified beyond rational thought. I ran downstairs searching desperately for someplace to hide. \n\nThe pounding seemed to follow me as if they had"," surrounded the house. I searched for a room to hide in that didn’t have windows. In desperation, I threw myself into a closet and locked the door. There was no light so I shone my phone around the cramped closet and sat on a box of cleaning chemicals. My breathing came in ragged gasps as panic and physical exertion conspired to send me into unconsciousness. \n\nThe pounding seemed farther away. I was able to calm myself enough to slow my breathing. I looked at the camera still mounted"," to the tripod. I turned on the camera and looked at the picture. It was blurry. My settings were still for taking pictures of stars. Any movement would blur the image. \n\n*So much for proof.* \n\nThe pounding had ceased. I listened with hopeful ears to see if my siege of terror was over.\n\nThat’s when I heard the terrible sound. It wasn’t a scream or pounding, or anything like that. It was the creak of a floorboard. I stopped breathing and listened. \n\n*It must’ve been my imagination.*"," \n\nThen I heard the heavy breathing. I crept up to the door and listened. It was right outside the door. I started shaking. After ten minutes the creature hadn’t ripped the door open and devoured me. I sat back down on the box and tried to relax. \n\nIf I was going to die then I was. There was nothing I could do with the creature right outside my door that was obviously hunting me. I relaxed and slowed my breathing. My adrenaline finally wore off and I crashed. I leaned my head against"," a shelf and waited for my inevitable death.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI woke sometime later.  I slowly sat up and stretched my neck to work out the kinks. I looked at my phone it said 3:33 AM. It also said, ‘low battery’. I had run out of options. I stuck my phone in my pocket, picked up my camera with the tripod still attached, and reached for the door. I turned the knob as quietly as possible and inched open the door. \n\nI stifled a gasp when I saw what looked like a giant bear rug curled up"," in a ball on the floor. Its breathing was loud and steady. I pushed the door open as far as I could and tried to squeeze through. \n\nThe door refused to open enough for me to fit. I looked down and saw the door was pressed against the creature’s foot. There was nothing for it. I had to move the foot or stay in my closet prison. \n\nI pushed with all my might. \n\nThe door opened another inch.\n\nI braced my back against the door frame and pushed again. The foot moved enough for me to"," escape. Then the creature stirred in its sleep. I froze halfway out the door. The creature began to move. It stirred and began moving its gargantuan arms, then its legs. Suddenly it kicked the door, throwing me back into the closet and slamming the door. \n\nI landed on my back and the wind was knocked out of me. I lay there, trying to regain my breath and assess the damage. I felt pain but didn’t think anything was broken. I slowly rose and approached the door. I opened it and"," peeked out. \n\nThe creature was still laying there, breathing slowly, apparently asleep. \n\nIts foot had moved and the door was able to open. I stepped through, pointing my tripod at the creature as though it were some magical sword that would help me if it woke up. \n\nI side-stepped through the door keeping my eyes on the mountain of fur laying in front of me and backed toward the front door. I glanced behind me just in time to see a second creature, wide awake, towering over me."," \n\nIt looked down and a low growl escaped it. \n\nI made a smelly puddle on the floor.\n\nIt sniffed and recoiled. \n\nI jumped at the chance and dove for the door. It was locked. I grabbed the latch and turned it every way until it opened. Once I was through the door, the creature regained its senses. In three strides it was out the door reaching for me. I slid across the hood doing my best Dukes of Hazzard impersonation, landed, and dove inside the car. \n\nThe camera and tripod jammed"," the door open. I started the car and threw it in reverse before the door was closed. I turned causing my door to swing open impacting the creature and sending it sprawling to the ground. \n\nI put it in drive and stomped the gas pedal. The car slid sideways until I eased off the gas. As I sped down the dirt road, I glanced in my rear view mirror. I could see the red of my taillights illuminating two of the creatures chasing me. I tried to go faster, but as soon as I stepped on the"," gas, a turn in the road slowed me down. I slid through several turns as fast as I could while staying on the road.\n\n*Trees can kill me just as effectively as those things.* \n\nThe dirt road emptied onto an asphalt road. I drove as fast as possible for an hour before I looked back again. My mirror showed only disappearing yellow lines. I slowed a little to the speed limit and didn’t stop until I was home. \n\nI sat in my driveway, waiting for the creatures to catch up to me and rip"," me to pieces. After twenty minutes, that didn’t happen. I got out of the car and went inside my house. I made sure the doors and windows were all locked. \n\nMy clock said it was 6:17 in the morning. I took a shower and changed. I was extremely tired. I laid down in bed and stared at the ceiling, replaying the last 6 hours. My mind tried to tell me I had dreamed the whole thing, but I looked at the blurry photo on the camera and wasn’t so sure. \n\nAfter trying and failing to sleep"," for a few hours, I decided to call the woman whose house I had just abandoned. \n\n“Hello?” she said on the third ring.\n\n“Hi, this is Tom, I was renting the house this week.”\n\n“Was?”\n\n“Yes, I had a little problem and had to leave.”\n\n“Oh? Was it anything serious?”\n\n“You could say that. I had to leave for… health reasons.”\n\n“I see …” she said. “Will you be going back?”\n\n“No!” I said a bit more forcefully than I intended.\n\nShe was silent for a long moment.\n\n“Did anything… strange…"," happen?”\n\nThe whole ordeal invaded my mind in a vicious flashback. I knew it wouldn’t be the last time. I was scarred for life. I would never look at the outdoors the same way again. \n\n“No,” I lied. “Nothing at all.”"],"title":"I went on vacation in the middle of nowhere.

I'd leave if I could but I'm not sure what would happen if I did.\n\nI bought this old house because it was big and cheap. It was built in the 1850's and I was drawn in by the original details. The hand carved wood trim and the gas light on the banister of the grand staircase sold the house to me before the agent could even try.\n\nOnce we moved in we started working on fixing little things and hiring contractors for the bigger jobs. The home"," inspection went surprisingly well for such a old home, most of the work that was needed was in the old stone wall basement.\n\nThe inspector pointed out that there was a well and a cistern in the basement, he mentioned that the well was about 10 feet deep to the water line and he had no real way of knowing how deep the water was. But it didn't matter anyways, we were going put a floor over it and make the section a closet or something to avoid any accidents. The cistern was about"," four foot by ten foot and somewhere around 4 foot deep. It was made from brick and still had pipes leading into it but it had been disconnected almost a hundred years ago when the original owners installed indoor plumbing. The inspector said it was bone dry and likely not going to cause me any issues but it would be expensive to remove.\n\nShortly after moving in we hired a local handyman, Ted, to cover the well and fix a few other issues in the basement. He was the first to go"," missing.\n\nI remember it well, I felt sick and decided to leave work early. I came home and the house had a damp smell about it, like wet lumber mixed with old dirt. I shouted down the steps to see if Ted was still working in the basement.\n\nNo response.\n\nI didn't suspect anything, I thought that I might be getting ripped off by a contractor taking longer breaks than he should but that was the worst thing it could be. But when I went downstairs I immediately knew something was wrong.","  The cistern was full of water and the floor between the well and the cistern was wet. It looked like a wet blanket had been pulled across the floor down into the well.\n\nI thought Ted had fallen down the well. I called 911 and they spent two days looking for him. He wasn't in the well and he never went home. Suddenly I was a suspect in a homicide.\n\nMy story checked out and I was never formally charged but that didn't mean things didn't change.

I was pegged a killer. Rumors flew that I was a serial killer and I was throwing bodies in the well to hide them.  It wasn't long after that when my wife decided"," to leave.

His arms were long and spindly ending in sharp pointed bones protruding from his decaying skin, clicking on the floor and he walked towards me.

It took a moment to realize where I was. Not at Vee’s beach party, and not with Marlee standing in front of me, rotting away into something that resembled a human being only in the abstract sense. I tried"," to remember what she’d said to me in the dream, but it was like trying to hold onto a fistful of water; droplets of it were already slipping in between my fingers and out of reach.\n\nI sped through my morning routine, eager to escape into the warm sunshine and fresh air. Mom had left an orange post-it note stuck to the fridge:\n\n*Don’t forget, Stephen is coming over for dinner tonight! ☺*\n\n*Love,*\n\n*Mom*\n\nHow could I have forgotten about it when she’d never told me in the first"," place? I tamped down the automatic swell of annoyance and left the apartment. It wasn’t until I was outside that I relaxed enough to mull over what we’d learned from Marlee’s phone. Colton might think otherwise, but I was certain she must have been dating a teacher at Harker. I closed my eyes, sifting through various memories. Pretty much all of our teachers had loved Marlee. Especially--\n\nI stopped so suddenly that the old lady who’d been walking a few feet behind me nearly collided"," with me. She shot me a dirty look, but I barely noticed it; my mind whirred frantically, putting all the pieces together. How often had Marlee volunteered to spend time with Mr. Cunningham after school? Whenever I’d bothered to ask her about it, she’d always hand-waved it off as doing extra credit, her face lit up and glowing.\n\nI remembered the time we’d encountered Mr. Cunningham while drinking beers at Memorial Park. Correction: the time *Marlee* had been drinking beers at the"," park. It had been during summer break, a month before school started. I’d been too wrapped up in agonizing over my SAT score to take a sip of beer until Marlene rolled her eyes and shoved a joint into my hands.\n\n“You’ll be fine,” she said. “You always are. Here, drink up.”\n\nAfter taking a few drags of the joint, I had to admit Marlee was probably right. I’d done all I could on the test; now I just had to wait for my results. I leaned back against the grass and stared up at the"," plum blossom trees surrounding us, my worry fading away under the weight of the perfect, velvet summer day. I could hear, somewhere in the distance, the gleeful shrieks of kids playing tag or hanging from the monkey bars in the playground at the bottom of the hill. I didn’t want this summer to end. This time next year, the three of us would be on our separate ways to college, scattered across the country from one another.\n\nI sat up to snag one of the beers, thinking vaguely that"," we should go to McDonald’s at some point, and caught movement out of the corner of my eye. A very familiar figure was walking up the hill towards us, two six-packs of Guinness beers stuffed under his arms. “Shit! It’s Mr. Cunningham!” I stubbed out the joint and frantically examined the scattered beer cans surrounding us. “Oh my god, what if we’re suspended? Or expelled?”\n\nBut Marlee just laughed and waved at him, an impish grin on her face.\n\n“What are you doing?” I hissed, close"," to hyperventilating. “Do you *want* us to get caught?” I could already imagine my life after getting expelled from Harker: constantly scrabbling for jobs without any chance of finding steady unemployment, unable to ever move Mom out of the shitty apartment we currently lived in. It wasn’t like Mom’s job paid that much money. Even if she’d never said so, even if she’d never once put the expectation on me, she *was* relying on me to get her out of there.\n\nMr. Cunningham strolled"," towards us. In a T-shirt and jeans, he looked about ten years younger than his actual age and cuter than ever. If it wasn’t for Mom’s storied dating history, I might have developed a crush on Mr. Cunningham too. But I’d learned earlier than I wanted to that getting attention from men in their twenties, when I was still a teenager, wasn’t flattering but creepy as hell. Myron was just one example that leapt to mind.\n\nHe glanced briefly at our beer cans, his mouth curling into a"," smile. “You guys look like you’re having a good time.”\n\n“We are,” said Marlee. “Any chance you’d want to join us?”\n\nI threw her an appalled look. I didn’t understand why she was being so bold; if Mr. Cunningham told the school administration about what he’d seen here, we’d be kicked out of Harker faster than you could say “underage drinking.”\n\nBut he just shook his head and laughed. “I’m good,” he said, jerking his head towards the beers he was already holding. “Should I ask how"," long you’ve been here? Or would the answer horrify me?”\n\nI opened my mouth to respond, but Marlee jabbed her elbow into my side without ever looking away from him. “The latter. But if we leave before you come back, will you promise not to tell anyone you saw us?”\n\n“Sure. It’ll be our secret.”\n\nMarlene saluted him with the beer she was holding, still smiling. “Here’s to keeping secrets.”\n\n*Here’s to keeping secrets*. Looking back on it, it had been so obvious. And I’d missed it"," anyway. But when I tried to reconcile the smiling, laidback version of Mr. Cunningham we’d encountered in the park with the version I had in my head of Marlee’s murderer, I drew a blank. Could he really have done it? Could he have pushed one of his students to her death?\n\nThere was only one way to find out. I needed to find evidence that Mr. Cunningham had been the one corresponding with Marlee. And if there was any evidence, I felt confident that it had to be on his phone. Of"," course, checking it was easier said than done; it wasn’t as though I could simply saunter up to his desk and snatch his phone out of his hands.\n\nLuckily, I didn’t have to think up a solution by myself.\n\n**Chloe:** I need your help\n\n**Chloe:** I need some way of getting into Mr. Cunningham’s phone\n\n**Chloe:** Pretty sure he’s who Marlee was dating.\n\n**Colton:** ???????????????????????????????\n\n**Chloe:** Think about it!\n\n**Chloe:** I mean, she spent so much time with him after"," school\n\n**Chloe:** Called him by his first name\n\n**Chloe:** Talked about keeping secrets with him\n\n**Chloe:** Who else could it be?!\n\n**Colton:** uhhhhh I don’t know\n\nThe speech bubble appeared and disappeared several times, as though Colton kept deleting and retyping whatever he meant to say. “Come on,” I muttered, tapping my fingers impatiently against my thigh as I headed towards my first class. AP Lit wasn’t until third period. “Hurry up, Colton.”\n\n**Colton:** seems like you’re"," jumping to conclusions again\n\n**Colton:** sorry\n\n**Colton:** but I’ve got ur back\n\n**Colton:** what do we do?\n\n**Chloe:** Still figuring that out\n\n**Chloe:** I’ll keep you posted.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nFor the first time since the school year had started, I looked forward to my AP Lit class. But once I was actually sitting in the classroom and directly across from Mr. Cunningham, doubt rose inside of me. I wasn’t expecting anything out of “The Tell-Tale Heart,” but if he had killed Marlee,"," shouldn’t there have been some sign of it on his face? He seemed the same as ever though. The cool teacher who occasionally swore, the one who seemed to *get* it. Who understood what it’d been like as a teenager, and who was on our side.\n\nInstead of paying attention to his animated lecture on *Troilus and Criseyde*, I stared at his phone, trying and failing to think of some way to get it out of his reach. It was an iPhone, similar to the one Marlee used to own, but beat up and"," scuffed, with cracks across the edges of the glass screen protector. If I could just get into it, I was sure I’d find something incriminating.\n\nThe bell rang, interrupting my thoughts, and I shoved my half-completed homework assignment into the black plastic letter tray. As I walked out of the classroom, someone tapped me on the shoulder and I jumped about two feet into the air. Chelsea stood behind me, her red-gold hair brilliant under the sunlight. “Sorry. But we need to talk,”"," she said.\n\nThis close to her, I noticed the dark circles under her eyes. And there was something in the way she held herself, her shoulders hunched, as though she expected someone to leap out at her at any second. I cleared my throat. “Uh, this isn’t really a good time for me. Maybe we could, like, talk next week or--”\n\n“It’s about Marlene.” I gaped at her. She couldn’t have said anything else that would have surprised me more. Chelsea had never gotten along with Marlee, even"," when we’d been dating. I remembered the countless fights we’d had over her, and how Chelsea had once said, her eyes red-rimmed with tears, *You’ll always care more about her than me.*\n\nI was going to be late to Physics, yet again, but I didn’t care. I texted Colton to join us and we both followed Chelsea as she wound her way through the campus and around the groups of other students. She led us straight into the girl’s bathroom opposite the art classroom, the one that no one liked"," to use because it only had three stalls and constantly went out of order. Colton balked at the threshold until I rolled my eyes and yanked him in after us. When we were inside, Chelsea even checked the stalls to see whether or not anyone else was there.\n\nAfter satisfying herself that we were alone, she took a deep breath and said, “This is going to sound completely bonkers. But I...” She fiddled with a strand of her hair, unable to look at either of us directly. “OK, you know"," what? I’m just going to say it. Two nights ago, I got a call from an unknown number and someone who sounded a lot like *Marlene* was on the other end of the line. I know that it makes zero sense, and it was probably just a prank call, but I keep getting these fucked up nightmares--”\n\n“Us too,” I said, cutting her off.\n\n“You...too?”\n\nBefore I knew it, I found myself spilling all of it out to Chelsea, telling her about our phone calls from Marlee, breaking into her parents’ house,"," and finding the hidden phone under her bed. I even told her my suspicions about Mr. Cunningham, and how I was sure that he had been the one dating Marlee. She listened to me with her eyes wide and concerned, but I didn’t see any disbelief on her face. If anything, the more I told her, the more relieved she looked.\n\nWhen I finished telling her everything, she said, with some of her usual fire back, “So, I’m *not* going crazy. You and Colton both got these calls. But why me? She"," never liked me.”\n\n“That’s not true!” I protested automatically, before thinking better of it.\n\nChelsea just *looked* at me. “You guys were the Three Musketeers, remember? Invitation only and no plus ones allowed.” Her voice held none of the old bitterness, only resignation. “You and Marlee never tried to include me. So, why...would...” she trailed off. “Wait a second.”\n\nColton asked, “What? What is it? What did she say to you?”\n\n“I would’ve told you guys sooner, but I assumed"," you knew already.”\n\nI made an impatient *go on* gesture. “Knew what?”\n\n“Marlene was pregnant.”\n\nMomentarily speechless, I leaned against the row of sinks next to me to steady myself. Colton looked equally shocked, and neither of us spoke for a minute. Several questions came to mind, and it took a while for me to find the one I really needed to ask. “Did she say who the father was?”\n\nChelsea was already shaking her head before I’d finished speaking. “No. I met her at O’Connor by"," accident. I went to visit my nana, and I saw Marlene sitting on one of those metal benches lining the walkway to the front entrance, you know? She was crying and--and I nearly walked away anyway. But she was there by herself. So, we talked and she told me she was waiting for someone. She kept saying wanted to keep it, but he didn’t want her to.”\n\nHoly shit. I paced around the tiny bathroom, unable to stay still. I still didn’t entirely understand why Marlee hadn’t told me, but"," it all made sense now. Of course, Mr. Cunningham couldn’t have let her keep their child; even if the relationship had been consensual, a teacher-student relationship was illegal in California. He would’ve lost his job, faced criminal charges and potential prison time. He had the perfect motive for murder. “Chelsea, I need to get into his phone somehow. There’s gotta be something between them on it.”\n\nI waited for her to argue with me, to tell me that I had to think twice about"," what I planned on doing. But instead, she simply nodded. “Right. How are we going to do that?” She saw the look on my face at the word “we,” and straightened up from where she’d been leaning against one of the stalls. “I might not have liked Marlene very much, but no one deserved to die like that. So, what’s our plan?”\n\n“Uh,” I glanced at Colton, but he didn’t offer any help. “We’re still trying to figure that out. I mean, he takes his phone everywhere with him; it’s practically"," glued to his hand. And even if I could get ahold of it, I don’t know his passcode.”\n\n“Yeah, but it’s an *iPhone*. It’s probably synced to all of his other Apple devices. Use his MacBook.”\n\nI blew out a breath, running a hand through my hair. “Okay, fair point, but that brings us right back to the same problem: how do I even get into his laptop? I won’t know the password.”\n\nChelsea gave a half-shrug. “He keeps all his passwords written down on a piece of paper in his desk. Anyway,"," if you get into his classroom fast enough, that’s not even an issue. The screen doesn’t lock right away.”\n\n“Right. We need some way to draw him out of his classroom. Something urgent enough that he’d want to leave immediately and forget all about his stuff and about locking his classroom door. Something he really cares about...something like...”\n\nWe exchanged a look. “Like his 2005 Ford 5T?” Chelsea suggested. “He’s always going on about how much he loves it. I could tell him"," someone vandalized it. I’m sure that would get him running out of his classroom fast enough to forget all about locking the door.”\n\n“That wouldn’t give me much time though. As soon as he saw it was okay, he’d head right back, wouldn't he? Unless it was actually vandalized.” If he caught me keying his car, I’d be expelled. No doubt about it. I imagined again, just as I had on that long ago summer day, my future if I never graduated from Harker. If this went onto my permanent record,"," and I wasn’t able to attend college, it wouldn’t just be me impacted, but Mom too. My grandparents.\n\nColton had been pale and silent this whole time, letting the two of us talk, but now he spoke up. “Do you guys even hear yourselves? You’re talking about this like it’s some kind of a game. But if he did murder Marlee, he’s dangerous. He’s not going to just let you walk out of there if he catches you.” I tried to interrupt him, and Colton just kept going, raising his voice to drown"," me out. “And now you’re talking about vandalizing his car? That’s a fucking misdemeanor! You’re really going to throw away your future like that, Chloe?”\n\n“I don’t hear you making any suggestions,” I retorted, infuriated by his condescending tone. “At least I’m *trying* to do something! Do you even want to catch him?”\n\nHe looked stung. “Of course, I do! She was my best friend. But so are you. You gotta see how dumb this plan is--we shouldn’t try to handle this by ourselves! Let’s"," go to the police.”\n\n“You’re the one who said that there’s no point in doing so! We don’t have any proof! If we go to them empty-handed, they’re just going to dismiss us.”\n\n“Yeah, but--”\n\nChelsea interrupted our argument. “Look, as charming as this little tete-a-tete is, we’re running out of time, and personally, I want to keep my GPA at a 4.0. Stay or don’t stay, Colton, but I’m with Chloe.”\n\n“Obviously I’m staying,” Colton said tightly. “And helping. But *someone* had to point"," out how stupid this is.”\n\nI turned to Chelsea, so grateful that I could have cried. “Do you think you guys could lead him out of the classroom? And stall him for long enough that I can finish checking his laptop?”\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nA few minutes before the lunch bell rang, I claimed a headache and slipped out of Physics early, heading straight towards the staff parking lot. I might not have known much about cars, but Mr. Cunningham’s car was impossible to miss; it had been painted a"," bright red with white stripes down its nose. It looked ridiculously sleek and beautiful next to the other teachers’ cars, as out of place as a swan in a brood of ducklings. He must have saved up a ton of money to afford it. I went over to it, darting quick glances over my shoulder to check for any other students.\n\nI slashed open the rear tires first, then deliberately dug my keys into the painted surface of his car. I made a series of four horizontal lines across the hood, wincing"," at the screech of metal against metal. Right as I finished up the last line, the lunch bell rang; there’d soon be dozens of students rushing out of classrooms and milling around nearby. I ducked behind the next row of cars and walked in a crouch until I safely reached the auditorium.\n\n**Chloe:** Done\n\n**Chelsea:** OK. We’re heading over to him now.\n\n**Colton:** this plan is so dumb\n\n**Colton:** srsly, let’s think of something else\n\n**Chloe:** Too late\n\nI arrived at Mr. Cunningham’s"," classroom just in time to hear Chelsea say, sounding genuinely distraught, “You need to come right away! Someone vandalized your car!” I had to jump back from the open door to avoid getting bowled over by Mr. Cunningham as he bolted from the classroom. Colton followed closely behind him, and Chelsea trailed after them both, giving me a quick nod: *all set, go for it.*\n\nI sprinted into the classroom and threw myself behind his desk. He’d taken his phone with him after all...but"," his MacBook was still here, and Chelsea had been right. The screen hadn’t locked yet. Hopefully she’d been right about him syncing his phone to his laptop too. I opened up the Messages app from Finder, my mouth dry with anticipation. Marlee had sent her last text to “Heathcliff” on November 15, 2021, and I went straight to that date, scrolling down the contacts list and scanning through the assorted text messages.\n\nMarlee’s texts weren’t there. Fuck.\n\nI checked his iCloud next,"," drumming my fingers impatiently against the desk. Luckily, he was still logged in, which meant all I needed to do was wait for the screen to load. It seemed to take eons instead of seconds, and I was uncomfortably reminded of the many glaring holes in our plan. I had maybe ten more minutes, at most, before he’d return, and no idea if that would be enough time.\n\nWhen the screen finally loaded, I scrolled down to November 2021 and saw--\n\nAbsolutely nothing. I scanned it one more"," time, disbelieving. He could have deleted all their texts, maybe, or used a different phone that wasn’t synced to his MacBook. Or...or maybe it really hadn’t been Mr. Cunningham. Coming up with this stupid plan, keying his car, jeopardizing my future--had it all been for nothing? I went to close out the tab, my mind frantically racing, still attempting to make sense of it all. There had to be something else I could try. Something else I could find that would be equally incriminating.\n\n*Use"," that big brain of yours to think*, I imagined Marlee saying. *What do people do on phones when they’re in relationships? They call each other, send each other texts, stalk each other’s social media, and...*\n\nI navigated back to the iCloud homepage and clicked on the Photos icon. There were a handful of different folders on the sidebar. I had that same feeling I’d experienced the day before, when I’d searched Marlee’s house; the sense that there was something important I was on"," the verge of discovering. So, I kept scrolling past the innocuous photos of dogs, food, sunsets, and hiking trips, clicking through each folder, and scanning its contents until I reached an untitled one located inside another folder titled “Nature.”\n\nThe photos loaded. And my breath caught in my throat.\n\nDozens of Marlees looked out at me from the screen. He’d taken so many photos of her, some of them featuring her partially undressed in the girl’s locker room. And when I kept"," going, I found photos of some of the other girls in my AP Lit class, all of them unaware of the camera. I swallowed down the nauseating wave of horror. It was like feeling the soft dirt at the edge of a cliff crumbling away under my feet, sending me tumbling down onto the sharp rocks below. There was no question now in my mind as to who had killed Marlee. He had done it. I’d taken Mr. Cunningham’s classes for almost two years, and for the past seven months, he’d been sitting at"," his desk smiling at us while Marlee rotted away in a pine casket.\n\n*Alright, Chloe*, I told myself. *You have your evidence.* I drew in a deep, shaky breath. I’d call the cops and hand the laptop over to them. They’d have to act then.\n\n“Chloe? What are you doing?”\n\nI jerked my head up to see Mr. Cunningham standing in the doorway of the classroom. His eyes traveled from the phone I was holding to the still-open laptop on his desk. Slowly, he shut the door behind himself and walked"," further into the room.\n\n“N-nothing. I mean, I had a question about, um, the presentation next Tuesday. But you weren’t here, so I--”\n\n“Were you the one who keyed my car?”\n\n“No!” I said too quickly. I stood up, hoping that he couldn’t tell my knees were shaking, and aimed for a nonchalant tone. “I should get going. Lunch is almost over and I like still have to get to Social Studies--”\n\nWe stared at each other, the expression on his face cold and remote as he advanced towards me."," I knew I had to keep the desk between us, but the problem was that it had been pushed up against the wall on the left side. I didn’t have anywhere to go. If I went around it, he’d grab me. If I went over it, he’d grab me. The seconds ticked away, each one of them counting down to the final timer, and I had no idea what to do.\n\nI couldn’t have told you how I realized he would leap at me moments before he actually did so--only that something in his expression gave it away. He ran"," towards me with his arms outstretched and his mouth turned down into a terrifying grimace, and I tore open my backpack, spraying its contents onto the ground. I had pepper spray in there somewhere. Front pocket. Side pockets. No, back pocket. *Where the fuck was it?*\n\nI found it just in time. In one smooth movement, I raised it and jammed my thumb over the button. Mr. Cunningham shouted in surprise and tried to get his arm up to block the pepper spray. He only partially succeeded."," I didn’t bother waiting around to see if he’d recover; I vaulted over his desk and weaved around the rows of desks towards the door. One of his hands swept down my back as I ran past him, seeking purchase, and I barely held in a scream.\n\nI reached the doorknob, twisted it, pulled the door open an inch--\n\nPain exploded in the back of my head. I involuntarily let go of the doorknob, my eyes watering. He’d hit me with something, and now he dragged me backwards by my hair. No matter"," how hard I struggled, I couldn’t get free, and every step was agony. I had enough time to think, *I’m so sorry, Mom*, and then his hands were closing around my throat and I couldn’t breathe.\n\nBlack and purple spots swarmed the edges of my vision. I tried to pry his fingers off my neck, scratching at them futilely. In response, he lifted me off my feet and turned me around to face him. The tendons stood out on his neck, and his eyes were bloodshot and watery from the pepper spray."," I tried to scratch at his face, but my arms weren’t obeying my brain’s orders anymore; they’d gone limp and the world was dimming, the tide of unconsciousness drawing inexorably closer.\n\nThere was a loud bang. And abruptly, his grip on my throat loosened. I dropped to the floor in a heap, too weak to raise my head more than a few inches. I couldn’t stop coughing, even though it hurt my throat worse than ever. Chelsea knelt down next to me. “Oh my god! Chloe, are you okay?”\n\nFinally,"," I managed to rasp out, “I’m fine. What happened?”\n\n“We realized something had gone wrong when you never responded to our texts. We came over and as soon as we opened the door, Mr. Cunningham dropped you. He didn’t even say anything to us, just shoved us aside and ran for it. Colton went after him. Are you *sure* you’re okay? You need a hospital.”\n\n“Photos,” I said, ignoring her last question. “On his laptop. Of Marlee and other students.”\n\nChelsea looked sickened. “Oh, gross."," Hold on Chloe. It’s going to be alright. He’s never going to hurt anyone ever again.”\n\nI closed my eyes and let myself believe her.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nEven though we lived only a few minutes away from Harker, Mom insisted on leaving work early and picking me up. And she hustled me into her car after telling the police officers I’d be at the police station tomorrow to make my statement. She kept throwing me concerned glances while I stared out the car window unseeingly. “Are you okay,"," honey?” she asked, reaching out to stroke my hair, as if to reassure herself I was still there.\n\nI nodded. I felt oddly numb, like someone had shot my entire body through with lidocaine. I’d thought that after catching Marlee’s killer, I’d feel triumphant, vindicated. And although I *was* relieved--Mr. Cunningham would never take another non-consensual photo of a student again--I didn’t seem capable of feeling anything else. What I really wanted, I realized, was to talk to Marlee"," one last time. But aloud, I only said, “I’m fine.”\n\n“Let me cancel dinner with Stephen. What we need is a night in, just the two of us. Maybe I could go to 99 Ranch Market and get us some zòngzi? Or I could go out and bring back some pearl milk tea...” She rattled off a string of different comfort foods.\n\n“Seriously, Mom. You don’t have to worry about me.”\n\n“It’s my job to worry about you,” she said. “I know you’re an adult now, but I’ll always be here for you, Chloe.”\n\nI turned"," to look at her. She smiled back at me, her eyes bright with tears. I’d wanted so badly to get an adult’s advice, to bring this problem to someone who’d take me seriously and know what to do next, but I’d never once considered reaching out to her. “Thanks, Mom,” I said quietly.\n\nAfter we arrived home, I headed straight to the bathroom, wanting nothing more than a long and hot shower. The bathroom mirror showed me the finger-shaped bruises around my neck more clearly than I wanted"," it to. I frowned, touching the skin there gingerly. My throat still felt hot and swollen, and I knew Mom would insist on visiting our family doctor.\n\nI turned to hang up my towel on the bathroom hook. When I turned back, Marlee stood behind me in the mirror. I screamed and knocked the mug holding my toothbrush to the floor, where it shattered into pieces. One shard cut open my left big toe, but I didn’t even notice the pain. Marlee was unmistakably dead; her neck still jutted"," unnaturally to one side, throat discolored, while her hair dripped with water. Her eyes were two glassy marbles. She raised both arms to her face, clawing bloodless grooves down her cheeks, and screamed, a piercing shriek that drilled into my ears. As soon as I turned around to check whether or not she was actually standing behind me, she vanished from the mirror. I stood stock-still for a few seconds, my heart pounding with terror.\n\n*Something’s wrong.*\n\nI left the bathroom,"," the shattered mug still on the floor. “Mom,” I said, my voice still hoarse and raspy. It hurt to speak, and my voice was barely louder than a whisper, but I pressed on anyway. “Mom, I need to talk to you!”\n\n“Just one second,” she called. “Come over here, Chloe, there’s someone I want you to meet.”\n\nSlowly, I walked over to the living room. Mom and a man I’d never met before were sitting on our small, worn living room couch, holding each other’s hands. He wore a blue button-down"," shirt and had messy brown hair. He already looked better put together than most of the men Mom usually brought home. She must have let him in while I’d been in the bathroom. I stared at them both, unmoving, feeling as though I was in another nightmare. One where I couldn’t move or speak or scream. *Something’s wrong, something’s wrong, something’s wrong...*\n\nMom still hadn’t noticed anything amiss yet. She turned to me and said brightly, “This is Stephen! You guys will get along"," great; I just know it.”\n\nHe stood up from the couch, looking both embarrassed and pleased. “It’s nice to meet you, Chloe. I’ve heard so much about you.” He reached out with his hand to shake mine, and that was when I finally saw it.\n\nThe thin scar that curved above his upper lip.\n\n[As he beamed at me, it stretched into a second smile.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Certain_Emergency122/)\n\n[ODD](https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/)"],"title":"My best friend has been dead for seven months.

It doesn’t matter, this PSA needs to come out. There is a dangerous paranormal entity that the government is trying to keep under wraps. They aren’t doing a very good job.\n\nThe thing about Melanie is that she reproduces (or should I say multiplies) every time she is seen through a screen. This includes pictures, videos, even drawings-If"," they are detailed enough. Someone on my team didn’t realize this and ended up taking a few pictures and videos of her using the CCTV cameras we have installed in her room- This jackass sent it to a few friends and somehow, it ended up here on Reddit as well.\n\nI don’t want to describe what happened to my coworker or his chain of friends, but we cannot let this propagate through the internet.\n\nI have had the misfortune of viewing this image myself and have included instructions"," on how I have handled this anomaly.\n\nThe first thing I want to do is describe what she looks like so the general public can know what to look for and immediately turn off their device if they see her. Please pay close attention to my description so you know what to look for and when to click off.\n\n**Phase 1**\\- Melanie presents herself in a few phases. The first phase will not hurt you at all. She will lull you into a false sense of security. She has dark hair and bangs, large"," blue-grey eyes, full lips, and high cheekbones. DO NOT let her beauty fool you. If you see an image or video of her, turn off your device immediately and pray to whatever you believe in that she didn’t see you. After a few hours, find a way to delete the image or video without looking at it directly. Use a mirror or sunglasses.\n\n**Phase 2**\\- If you are seeing a video of her, Melanie will eventually transform into this phase. Somehow pictures will change as well if you open them"," for a second time. I still don’t fully understand how this works. Phase two looks similar to phase 1 except much more unsettling. This time, she is looking directly at you with eyes twice as large as before. Her face seems to age at least 10 years and her lips start to form a toothy smile. If you see this phase of Melanie, I would still consider you lucky. Turn off the device, burn it or dowse it in acid. Dispose of it in a way that ensures no one else can somehow manage to get"," it working again. For the next 7 days, sleep with a crucifix within arms reach and make sure to shut your bedroom door until daylight.\n\n**Phase 3-** If you reach this phase, don't bother doing anything with your device. She has already found you. Melanie’s face will have twisted into pure malice. Her skin will turn a grey/blue hue, almost like a fresh corpse. Her features twisted into a devilish grin, displaying her nubs of yellow teeth. She appears humanoid but has longer arms"," and may choose to walk on all fours. The image/video won’t show her full form. You won’t be able to see that until she appears in your home.\n\nI know many people have already seen her in this state and so I am including a few tips on how to go about living your new life:\n\n* Please name her. I chose Melanie, you choose something else for your version. She prefers flowery, feminine names such as: Bella, Celine, Esmeralda etc.. Please choose something like that so as to not anger"," her. Someone I knew called her a more gender-neutral name. He didn’t live to see another minute.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Make friends with a local butcher. Try to buy in bulk to save some money. What do you need to buy? Well, mostly bones and organ meat. Some muscle meat but she doesn’t really seem to like it. Buy blood as well. Leave some of that out every night, preferably as far from your bedroom as possible. Keep her well fed and she has no reason to… eat anything else. Sleep with"," a fan on or some headphones. You don’t want to hear her eat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* You can stay anywhere you would like instead of home. A friend's house, hotel, etc. Make sure you leave enough food and drink for her and do not leave her at home longer than you would leave a cat. If you follow that, she will have no reason to come out and find you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Stay away from windows and doors after sunset. Why? I’m not really sure. Every time I got closer than a few feet from"," my bedroom window, she would shriek and bound towards me.I would have to try my best to de-escalate the situation. Daytime is a lot better. I can go about my business while she sleeps(I assume she is sleeping, but it's hard to tell what she is doing in my basement).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* She may speak with you. Tempt you. Promise to leave if you can do her a favor. If you ever hear that horrible, layered voice, cover your ears as soon as possible. Headphones, white noise, earplugs."," Ear protection should be on your person at all times.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Please keep Melanie as far away from children as possible. If you have any kids, Make sure that they don’t live with you. Melanie seems to enjoy bones from younger animals much more and I don’t know how much that translates to humans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* Finally, and this is the most important rule. DO NOT close any doors in your house. Not your bedroom, not even your bathroom. She likes to make sure you’re still"," there.\n\nSome of these rules I learned through the documents and word of mouth. I had to find out one of them the hard way. When Melanie ‘moved in’ I had no idea what to feed her, so I decided on cat food from the store. Horrible idea. The second she caught sight of the round dish of kibbles, I became petrified by the demonic rage that filled her twisted features. She threw the dish at the wall so hard that it broke into pieces. Before I could even react, she then lunged at me."," In one quick motion she ripped my arm off before the elbow. I will never forget the sickening crack as I watched the blood, flesh, and bone eject from my body, just to become a snack for this disgusting creature.\n\nIf you follow these steps to the letter, you should be okay. DO NOT take any pictures or videos of Melanie (or whatever you name her). I think each replication will die when its host dies, so long as no one takes more pictures of her.\n\nIf everyone can hold their end"," of the deal, this curse should be over in just one generation.\n\nAgain, the best case scenario is to read my descriptions and make sure to turn off your device the second you see something matching them. Otherwise, follow the rules. And you should be okay.\n\nI will post updates here as I learn more. For now I need to head back home. I have spent far too long at this library and I wouldn’t dare keep her waiting much longer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: Hi, Melanie here. Simon thinks I sleep"," all day while he’s at work huh?

Truth be told, I was probably too drunk to even sit in a parked car without all of the windows open, but I had places to be, so I kept the pedal down.

Either way, the few cars I did encounter were easy to pass even though I started to feel like a toddler struggling to stay inside the lines with every swerve. \n\nIt was hot for December,"," so I did have my window down. My headlights were blinking in and out; I’d get them fixed eventually, maybe tomorrow, maybe next month. In that flickering light, I saw a deer sprint out from the trees at the shoulder of the road and then across the highway. Another swerve and another near miss. My heart was in my throat but I felt good, my buzz was still roaring. \n\nThere was a bright patch ahead on the highway. My vision was a little blurry but it was clearly a town. My stomach"," cramped and rumbled. I was *starving*. I saw a speed limit sign on the shoulder for 50 miles per hour. Grinning, I sped up until the needle was pushing seventy-five.

It looked empty but open. I pushed the glass door and grinned when"," a little bell rang above me. \n\nMy smile dropped as I noticed the two workers behind the counter. The guy was tall, looked to be in his early thirties, and had a busted-up face like he’d just walked in from a fight club behind the restaurant. Nasty purple and yellow bruises covered his cheek, sat under his eyes, and peeked out from his collar. He must have been covered in them under his uniform. The girl next to him was both more and less off-putting. She appeared to be about the"," same age, much shorter, pretty in a hollow way with her blonde hair and black glasses. There was no visible damage on her but a dark stain soaked the bottom half of her shirt. It was reddish-brown, maybe some kind of sauce. \n\n*Hopefully*, some kind of sauce. \n\n“You okay?” I asked her, walking towards the counter. \n\nThe girl didn’t reply, didn’t even look at me. The young dude next to her picked at a shallow cut next to his ear. \n\n“What can I get you?” he asked. \n\nI blinked and"," tried to shake some of the fermentation from my brain. “Tacos.”\n\n“Yes, sir, this would be the place for that. What kind? How many?” \n\n“Uh. Five chicken. Five beef. One of those crunch wrap things. Nachos. Some cinnamon twists. Oh, and a diet Coke. Oh! And as much diablo sauce as you can give me.” \n\n“Is that all?” \n\nI put a hand on the counter to steady myself. “Yeah. And I need to take a leak.” \n\n“Bathroom’s back there,” the guy said, pointing to a pair of doors in the corner."," \n\nI turned away from the counter and took a step towards the restroom then stopped. Now that I had a full view of the dining area, I saw that there were people sitting at one of the tables. They weren’t there when I walked in, I was positive of that. Maybe they entered while I was ordering but…I didn’t hear the bell above the door ring. It was like they just appeared.\n\nI counted three men and a woman, all different ages, all equally awful looking. It was like they were sick, pale"," and bloodless, with ringed, sleepless eyes. One of the guys had a red-brown stain just like the girl at the counter, only his covered the back of his shirt. They all watched me silently as I walked past them towards the bathroom. I only tripped once. I was pretty proud of that. \n\nWhile the rest of the Taco Bell was relatively clean and well-lit, the bathroom looked like I might catch a disease just by taking a deep breath. The floor was dirty, the walls were stained, the lights"," flickered, and it smelled *vile*. One of the two stalls didn’t have a door. The other did but was occupied, a pair of ragged cowboy boots visible under the wall. Whatever. There was an open urinal and that was all I needed. It was disgusting and clogged but I did what I needed to do and went to wash my hands.\n\nWhile I was cleaning up, I took a look at my reflection in the mirror. It was wrong. I mean, it was me, but my face was as pale as the weirdos in the dining room. There"," was an angry red cut above my eye on my forehead. I reached up to touch it and felt something prick my finger. I jerked my hand away then went back to probe around gently. There was a small triangle of class sticking in the cut. I pulled it out and dropped it into the sink, hands shaking as I turned on the water.\n\nThere was a loud *bang* from behind me. I whirled around in time to see the door of the occupied stall shake. It was like the guy inside was slamming into it. \n\n“You"," okay, buddy?” I called out, feeling a lot soberer than I had in hours. “Are you-”\n\nThe door shook again, louder than before. There was a strange, quiet wailing sound coming out of the stall. It grew to something halfway growl, halfway scream. I turned away, closing my eyes. I must have hit my head at some point, I was imagining things or-\n\nI opened my eyes to find the mirror in front of me completely fogged. As I watched, something invisible dragged against the mirror, drawing"," a shape or letters in the fog. I didn’t stick around to find out what the message was; I left the bathroom running. Once I burst out of the door, though, I stopped so quickly I tripped. The dining room was full. And the people at the tables and in the booths looked like they’d been dragged out of the local morgue. Men and women, a few teenagers and old folks; they were all in various stages of decomposition. I saw missing limbs, exposed ribs (one so raw I could see a gray sack"," of unmoving lung through it), cuts and holes and everywhere that red-brown stain. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant didn’t look so clean anymore, either. Now it resembled the bathroom with mold in the corners and a thick, white-green fluid in puddles on the floor. Everything reeked. I couldn’t tell if it was the decaying people or the dirty room but the smell was like a physical force scorching my throat and eyes and twisting my stomach. \n\n“Your order, bud,” a voice said behind"," me. \n\nI turned and saw the guy from the counter carrying a tray full of rotting food. The tacos were covered in a fuzzy mold and the rest of the pile was alive with a squirming knot of glossy white maggots. I slapped the tray and stumbled back, then ran for the door. The little bell from earlier was now just a rusted lump. I pressed against the bar again and again but the door wouldn’t open. The dead things behind me were laughing, soft at first then hysterically as I slammed"," my shoulder into the glass so hard I bounced off. Their laughter became a buzz like flies over summer roadkill. \n\n“The door’s locked,” I heard the man from the counter say. “You can’t leave.”\n\n“The Hell I can’t,” I growled, standing up. \n\nI felt something grab me and press my face against the glass door.\n\n“***Look***,” a deep voice demanded. \n\nI did. Then I began to sob. In the orange sodium glow of the parking lot lamps, I saw my Camaro. It was destroyed, wrapped halfway around"," a streetlight. It was no longer a car, only a lump of metal and broken glass. What I saw lying in the parking lot was worse, though. A man, just my size, dressed just like me, crumpled like a doll dropped from up high, soaking in a pool of blood. He…I…had been thrown through the front windshield during the crash. That moment when I accidentally hit the pedal instead of the brake…what if I’d actually kept on the pedal.\n\n“Heck of a way to die,” I heard the counterman whisper. “You"," shouldn’t drive drunk, buddy; too easy for people to get hurt. Thank God this looks like a one-car crash. A single fatality. Now go grab a uniform from the back. You’re going to be working here for a very, *very* long time”\n\n“No,” I said, pulling back, “this isn’t real. This isn’t fair. I have to leave.”\n\nThe man’s grin turned into a snarl. He slapped me, hard and quick, then hit me again, this time with an open fist. I stumbled back into the front door. The short girl that was"," behind the counter when I came in hit me next; she grabbed at my collar and scratched my neck. Someone else slammed into me from the side and then I was on the ground. Figures crowded over me, dead legs kicking my ribs, stomping me, grinding me into the tile. Blows fell on me like hail on a window. I begged and screamed and whimpered but they kept hitting me. Then, searing agony; the man was pressing his open palm to my chest, burning me, branding me.\n\nEventually, the dead pulled"," back. I stood up, bruised and ruined, and decided to take my chance. I ran at the locked door, arms in front of my face to protect my eyes. I jumped and felt the glass break and-\n\nI woke up on the pavement feeling like every bone in my body was broken. \n\n“Hrrrgh,” I groaned, spitting out a tooth. \n\nSomeone was standing over me. I flinched when they leaned down. \n\n“Easy, buddy,” a voice said, “I called 9-1-1. They’ll be here soon.” \n\nI blacked out and woke up much later in a hospital"," bed. The doctors told me I was lucky to be alive after the crash and being ejected through the windshield of my Camaro. My injuries from the accident were severe but non-fatal: a broken arm, four busted ribs, a concussion, two lost teeth and another cracked, as well as every inch of me covered in road burns and deep bruises. Since it was a DUI, I wouldn’t be driving again any time soon and could face fines, maybe even some jail time. \n\nI accept that. Whatever the consequences,"," I know that I truly am lucky. I escaped Hell. \n\nWhat I didn’t escape, though, was a permanent reminder of my visit. There’s a puckered red scar on my chest in the shape of a large handprint. The burn aches every day but most of all whenever a dark thought enters my mind."],"title":"Taco Hell"},{"content":["If there's one thing I would ever go to jail for, it's trespassing. As a kid who lived in an upper middle-class neighborhood, who had gotten bored of every hobby my parents funded, I had too much time on my hands. Especially during the summer, I would always be trying to find new stupid shit to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt seventeen years old, my newest hyperfixation became going into the unoccupied houses that did not yet have tenants. However, once you've seen one empty house, you've seen them"," all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI started going to abandoned shops, lots of land that were still for sale, storage facilities, etc. These were all places within walking distance of home. I didn't have a lot of options since I was still procrastinating on getting my license at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy strategy of walking around aimlessly until I found a cool place to explore, was starting to yield less and less results. I was on the roof of my parents house one day while they weren't home. As expected,"," there was nothing particularly interesting up there. I ended up lying down, staring at the clouds. I was bored out of my mind, and trying to fight the urge to start breaking into occupied homes just for the thrill of it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, I always knew my behavior would get worse with age, and that life wouldn't end well for me when I took it too far. That didn't change the fact that I still wanted to slow down the process of my downfall for as long as possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI"," looked to the left and saw the local water tower peeking over the horizon. You could barely see the top since most of it was obscured by the woodline. An alternative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the front of every suburban neighborhood is a playground, sometimes with a tennis court and a basketball court beside it. Surrounding this area was a line of trees, separating normal civilization from an area of the woods that the neighborhood had not yet expanded into.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis water tower was just"," a half mile into those woods, the only connection to civilization being a dirt road that led right up to it. If anyone was gonna come by for maintenance, it'd be through that one road cutting through the trees. I would see them a mile away, and nobody in their right mind would unexpectedly cut through the woodline behind the playground to catch me trespassing. The risk was low, and I needed something to keep me entertained. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNobody was at the playground at the time, so"," I was clear to enter the woods. The water tower was a lot smaller looking up close than I thought it would be, and it was surrounded by a fence topped with barbwire. I was a little disappointed, but hey, beggars can't be choosers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hopped the fence, cutting the shit out of my hands and ankles in the process, and took a look around. There was a sort of ladder sticking out the side. Surprisingly, it was easily accessible and I had no trouble getting to it. I took one last"," look around before I began climbing. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow easy would it be for someone far away to spot me while I climbed the tower? You know what, who cares. It's not like anyone would know who I was from that far anyways, and if the cops were called, they would have to come down the dirt road, giving me at least a minute to climb down and make my escape.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting up to the balcony was kinda neat I guess. I didn't expect to see anything interesting, but man was I dangerously"," close to doing worse crimes already. The slippery slope was extra slippery that day, so I decided it could hurt to climb further, up on top of the actual tank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe roundness of it gave me a good adrenaline rush as I struggled not to slip downward. Using my palms like a lizard, and pushing the toe of my shoes into the wall to lift myself up, I got onto the top in no time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second I stood up, I saw a person on the dirt road staring right up at me. I sighed, throwing"," my hands up in the air. I was already exhausted from the climb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Welp, you caught me!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe man didn't respond. I stared back at him, just kinda waiting to see what would happen next. Apparently nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI noticed he was unusually tall. At least seven feet. Tall enough that I could see his face. I assumed it was my imagination, but something about his eyes looked alien. For starters, they were pretty huge. The longer I looked at it, the more I felt the tug of"," a vaguely familiar feeling, long since forgotten and tucked away in the far corners of my mind. Fear.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt had been a while, and I missed the sensation. I decided to try amplifying it a little by pulling out my phone, and zooming in on the man with my camera. Just like I thought, his eyes were super fucked up. No corneas, no iris, no pupils, just static. The kind of static you would see on a TV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's strange how quickly your heart will start beating fast and hard, the"," exact moment you see some weird shit. How does your body know to do that?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI needed more. I excitedly climbed down to get a closer look at the guy. When my feet hit the grass, I couldn't see him anymore. He wasn't anywhere on the dirt road, and somehow I didn't hear a sound in the woods surrounding me. Even the squirrels running around would make enough noise to make me spin around, thinking there was a human nearby. But this weird man with the static eyes disappeared without"," a trace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas he some sorta supernatural entity, or was this an elaborate prank?  I would have fun with it either way, so I tried to find him. To make a long story shorter, I didn't.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI didn't see him until the next time I climbed the water tower and saw him again. Just like last time, he was gone when I climbed down. Luckily, this time, I had brought a new drone I saw on Amazon. I was gonna sit on the tower, flying it around while I watched the camera footage on my"," phone, but now I was using it to try to find out where the man ran off to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI sat down on the dirt road, watching the camera footage as I flew the drone above the trees to scout the area. Part of me didn't expect to see him at all, which made it surprising when I saw him standing on the road the second I went higher than the water tower. He stared straight up at the camera, and right next to him was yours truly, obliviously staring down at his phone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI jumped to my"," feet, tunnel visioned and ready to fight for my life. I was staring right at where I saw him in the footage, but he wasn't there. I spund around, assuming I was already too late to avoid being stabbed from behind, or knocked out with a led pipe, or something.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe wasn't around. One hundred percent gone without a trace. I froze, listening as silently as possible. I remember being annoyed at how much noise my heartbeat was making, but I tried to pay attention to every tiny sound,"," every slight change in the wind, every shadow...\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbruptly, there was a loud crack, accompanied by absurdly fast movement in my peripheral vision. I flinched with my entire body, stumbling backwards with the all grace of an orangutan with parkinsons. In that moment, I was completely unprepared to defend myself, and my mind was bank. After falling on my ass, limp with fear and ready to shit a hole in my pants, I realized it was just the drone. It fell from the sky after I"," was spooked enough to forget steering it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI got to my feet, brushed myself off, and made a deep sigh that turned into hysterical laughter. That was awesome! The most fun I think I had in a decade at least.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow there was no doubt in my mind. This was definitely a supernatural entity, and I could not wait to start fucking with it. As far as I was concerned, this was my new toy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had a new theory that he could only be seen by people who were high enough above the"," ground, so I decided to test this out. My drone was broken, so I had to climb the water tower again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile on the tank, I climbed from the side closest to the road so I could have a better view of it. Without taking my eyes off the road, I eventually saw him the second I stood atop the tower. It seemed like a bit of an arbitrary measurement for making him appear. Maybe he was a ghost that died by falling off this very water tower?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI tried slowly kneeling down. I stopped"," seeing him when my head went down about three feet. That specific spot in the air seemed to he the threshold. I was 6'2, meaning that if I was 5'11, I would have never known about his existence in the first place. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaybe it wasn't the tower itself. Maybe it was how thin the atomosphere got, or maybe a specific elevation above sea level, or maybe a personal limit set by the man himself in order to hide his face. Whatever the case, it was pretty cool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI called my friend"," Cameron. Well, I wouldn't say friend. More like a timid loner who for some reason had this strange need to be liked by me. He would follow my every command religiously.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasically I called him, we made some chit-chat, and I convinced him to come to the water tower. He protested at first, making complaints about spiders and not liking the woods and... etcetera. I told him to stop being a bitch and he came over.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of cutting through the woodline, I watched him come"," alllll the way down the dirt road like the goody-two-shues he was. Sigh.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen he got to the water tower, he didn't seem to notice the seven foot tall man beside him, but he did see me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Ian! What are you doing?!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yo, Cameron. Mind doing me a favor?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Yeah, don't worry! Just stay calm....\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said, pulling out his flip phone (the poor fella had strict parents) and beginning to dial 9-11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Wha-? No, I'm not stuck, idiot! Just listen for a sec.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfused,"," he put him phone away.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Do you see anybody next to you?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI asked. He looked around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"No... Why?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Alright, Cameron. What I want you to do is extend your left arm.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Like this?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was close to touching the entity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Good, now take two steps to the left while keeping your arm up.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe did as he was told. He wasn't quite touching him yet, although his hand was less than an inch from their shoulder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Just a liiitle more.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Oka-\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe"," second he made contact, Cameron vanished entirely. In that same instant, I heard his voice coming from all directions. Horrendous screams of agony. He sounded like he was being electrocuted in the nutsack while thousands of termites munched on his pancreas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI nearly stumbled off the tower. The sound was hitting me directly from all sides, despite there being no trace of its source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas Cameron now just a disembodied mind experiencing no sensation other than suffering?"," I climbed down from the tower in a hurry to get away from those shrill, deafening screams. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"IT HURTS\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe screamed in a breif moment of semi-coherence. He seemed to have difficulty stopping himself from screaming long enough to form sentences. After several attempts, he was able to cry out the word \"help\" before continuing the screams.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I hoped the fence and looked back up at the tower, I could see a strange bundle of vibrating neon light, continually expanding"," into nothing. The source of the sound.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI figured people would come rushing over, and I could just pretend to be one of them, but nobody came. I cut back through the woods again to see children playing on the playground, neighbors at the tennis court, and couples on the bench making smalltalk. Nobody could hear the screaming except for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter walking home, the echoes of his screaming still traveled across the sky, all the way to my parents house. I could hear it"," when it was in my room. Annoyed, I put my headphones in and took a nap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI woke up around 3am, wondering who the hell was making such a ruckus, and then I remembered. I went out onto my balcony, and could hear the screams echoing over the otherwise silent neighborhood. To anyone else, this would be a peaceful night.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI could hear Cameron occasionally force out a word or two. Ow, help, please make it stop, someone please, etc. I climbed onto the roof to get a better look"," at the water tower. I could see the neon lights above it more clearly in the dark. It actually kinda looked like a portal. Portal to hell maybe?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, I got fed up pretty quickly. After three days it was clear the noise wasn't going to stop. I didn't want my own personal symphony of repetitive screams and complaints. The nature of the screams suggested that Cameron hadn't even slightly got used to the pain, as if whatever was hurting him found a way for the pain"," to be fresh and novel, no matter how much time had passed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt some point, I noticed that his number had been deleted off my phone. When I saw his parents, I said hi to them. They made no mention of him either. I tried asking them \"how's your kid doing?\" and they laughed and said I was mistaken, that they never had any kids. It was kinda hard to hear them over Cameron's screams, ironically enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it seemed like I was the only one who was gonna go deaf by 30 because"," of this, and also the only one who remembered Cameron. For now at least. I was sure I would eventually move somewhere else and forget about this whole saga while I looked for something different to be entertained by.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut I wasn't that patient. Another eight days passed, and I was ready to pour boiling acid down my ear canals. I did what any sane person would do. I discretely borrowed my dad's rifle at one in the morning, and brought it to the water tower. I put it in a"," guitar case just so when I was seen on the security cameras, it just looked like I was out for a late-night gig or something. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the water tower, I put in my noise canceling headphones and climbed to the top. The portal was about ten feet above me when I stood atop the tower, and there seemed to be something moving inside it. But I wasn't here to investigate. I was here to shoot that fucker causing him to scream endlessly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the flashlight attached to the scope,"," I was able to get a pretty clear view of the static eye man. It occurred to me suddenly that just because nobody could hear the screams, doesn't mean that nobody would be able to hear the gunshot. I needed to get this right on my first shot, immediately climb down, and get the hell out of there before someone came to investigate the noise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI looked up a quick YouTube tutorial on how to hit a target with the type of rifle I was using. There were a few fundamentals involving"," breathing, aiming, and uh... a couple others. I don't remember now, but I had it nailed down at that moment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI got into the least awkward kneeling position I possibly could, where I could still see the man.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"This is your only warning. Either stop this annoying disturbance, or find a way to turn the volume down!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I CAN'T\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYelled Cameron, thinking I was talking to him. Apparently he could hear me when I was close to the portal. He went back to shrieking"," at the top of his lungs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI aimed, keeping my breathing as controlled as I could, doing my best to filter out the noise. With my finger on the trigger, I pulled slowly... ever so slowly... there was more resistance than I thought. I found myself gripping the trigger pretty hard, knowing at any second there would be recoil and a s- God dammit. I still had the safety on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis time I didn't think about it too much, as I was getting impatient. The second the round fired,"," hitting the man directly in the forehead, he moved. He was now standing right in front of me, and began lumbering towards my direction while staring blankly into the distance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI jumped the fuck off the entire water tower, making sure to land on the outside of the fence. The gun fell onto the towers balcony with a clang. In mid air, time seemed to slow down a little for me. I had just enough time to realize I would rather break one leg instead of two so I could run away."," \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI stuck one leg out to receive the worst of the impact, and did just that. I scrambled into an animalistic, three-legged run. I bolted through the woods, breaking through stray branches, struggling not to trip over roots, brushing against thorn bushes, and exhaling so much dust. The sound of Cameron's screams got closer and closer no matter how fast I went.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I ended up in a clearing, I saw the neon portal in front of me. The sound wasn't chasing me, I'd been"," running toward it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI looked up behind me. No sign of the man. There was no portal above the water tower anymore, which confirmed that this was the same one. It moved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI walked over to the other side to see if I could get a good look at what was moving around in it before. If you guessed it was Cameron, squirming around in pain, you would be correct. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe was hovering inside it, unable to move himself in any direction. It didn't stop him from desperately flailing"," his arms and legs around. He stopped when he saw me, and reached a trembling arm. His arm was actually long enough to hang out of the portal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe begged, screaming at me to pull him out. I was wearing gloves, so I didn't think anything would happen to me if I grabbed his hand. I could feel the pain in my leg start to creep in, so I wanted to get this over with. When I pulled on his wrist, there seemed to be an invisible force pulling against me, but it wasn't hard to overpower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe"," screaming Cameron actually began to come out. By the time he was hanging halfway out of the portal, he was able to hold back the screams. Now he only made stifled grunts through gnashed teeth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen regular gravity started to apply to him somewhat, I suddenly had an idea. Wouldn't it be funny if I just let go and walked away? I considered pretending like I was about to do that, only to say just kidding and finish pulling him out.\n\n\n\n\n\n....but that's when I noticed. Cameron's"," screams weren't as loud as they were before, and his voice even now was strangely quiet. It was like someone used the remote from the iconic Adam Sandler movie \"Click\" to literally turn him down.\n\n\n\n\n\nI let go, and the portal wasted no time pulling him back in. Cameron once again shrieked in agony, begging, cursing, demanding me to help him. I just smiled. This is exactly what I needed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnowing that he was there, suffering indefinitely, would give me the high I needed"," to get me through the day. It added flavor to my life. I could visit him now and then when it started to get stale, give him some false hope, and then let the portal take him again to re-ignite my excitement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regular sting of my everyday boredom wouldn't be as bad as it usually would. I could just think about him screaming in the pain portal, and get off on it once again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Sorry Cameron, but it's getting kinda late and I need to get some rest. You know how it"," is. I'll come help you out tomorrow if I have time. Later!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI ignored the rage-filled screams and insults as I turned around. I bumped right into the man, the myth, the legend himself, Mr static eyes, and I stumbled back. There was a bleeding wound on his forehead, right where I shot him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe took a step closer to me, and I was too stunned to move. I definitely touched him just now, and he definitely remembers me shooting him in the head. Is he about to punish me the"," same way he's punishing Cameron?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe opened his mouth, about to speak for the first and only time, and his words would change the trajectory of my remaining existence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe said to me:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Is this more to your liking?\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHesitantly, I nodded. He nodded back, and then vanished. I didn't understand how he came to be, or why any of this was specifically the way it was, but they say not to look a gifthorse in the mouth. From that day forward, I had nothing but gratitude"," for the supernatural entity I came across that summer."],"title":"I climbed the water tower in my neighborhood"},{"content":["I remember the day, not too long ago, that I stood in front of my brand new home.  After the year-long headache of the over-budget and over-delayed build process, I finally held the keys to the castle of my 11.4-acre Kingdom.\n\nThe exhaust note from the contractor’s truck finally faded, leaving only the shrill woosh of the wind blowing against the structure.  \n\nThe rambler stood broad and strong under the increasingly low and dark clouds that promised a chilly fall storm.  The exterior"," was fashioned of white brick and white wood paneling, designed to appear in a sort of rustic-barn styling.  Front and center was a light brown double door made from pine with three matching pillars on each side to support the covered front porch.  The garage was facing the side.\n\nI had seen the house several times during the build process, but now that it was complete, it felt different.  The house appeared ominous against the daunting clouds of the incoming storm.  The yellowing"," grass from the sod that was planted too late in the season to properly root, along with the various shades of brown of the fields behind the house, added to the effect.  Lightning struck in the distance behind the house as if the scene was posing for a perfect photoshoot.\n\nAlthough it was brand new, the house had a noticeable essence, in the sort of way that a historical relic older than any person alive makes you wonder about the events said relic has seen.  If a house could"," have an “old soul”, this house had one.  It was designed to appear rustic, of course, but there was something special that I just couldn’t quite put my finger on.\n\nA gust of cold wind reminded me that I had little time before the storm would unleash pounding rain and violent wind.\n\nI took a deep breath as I walked in, inhaling the smell of fresh paint and carpet.  *My* paint and *my* carpet.  With each step, my boots echoed through the open living area’s bare walls, hardwood floors,"," and vaulted ceiling.  When I had previously been inside the home, it was busy with workers and conversation.  Now that it was empty, though, my 3,250 square feet felt oddly large to the point of being nearly lonely.  \n\nFor the past year, I’d been living in a cozy 5th wheel camper while waiting for the construction to finish.  As I wandered through my new home, it crossed my mind that maybe it was a bit excessive for a single 29-year-old after all.  Still, I had no regrets about"," it.\n\nI walked through the master bedroom first, admiring the luxury of space I’d have.  The California King bed I ordered would easily fit, with plenty of room to spare.  Hell, the closet was roughly the size of my bedroom growing up.  \n\nI strolled through the rest of the house, realizing that I had underestimated just how much furniture I would need to fill the large open spaces of the house.  It was overwhelming to think of all the furniture it would take, so I decided an interior"," designer would be the best option.  \n\nAfter locking the door behind me, I took one last look at the house.  *My* house.  I finally allowed myself to smile at my new symbol of success.  That’s what the house truly was, whether I wanted to admit it to myself or not.  I didn’t *need* all that space, I *wanted* to stick it to those who doubted me, underestimated me, and looked down upon me.  I wanted a place to set down roots, maybe a place for a family one day, but my middle finger"," played a big part in my decisions. \n\nMy furniture was set to arrive in 10 days.  Until then, it was back to the camper before the storm hit.  If only I knew the real storm that was on its way, I’d have turned away and never gone back.\n\n************* one week later *************\n\nMoving in honestly wasn’t much of a move.  The furniture company delivered everything and arranged the house to the orders of my attractive interior designer, Rachel.  Everything else that I owned, I simply"," carried out of my camper and into the house.  Rachel was unpacking all of the kitchenware she purchased on my behalf and rolled her eyes at me when I set my coffee maker on the counter.  \n\n“Nope, hide that away.  You can’t have a RED coffee maker when all of the appliances are stainless steel.”\n\n“Why not?”  I asked.\n\n“Because it’s hideous!”  She said, throwing her arms above her head with a laugh.  “This, this is why you’re single.” She said in a way that wasn’t insulting, but"," perhaps slightly flirtatious.\n\n“Or maybe it’s because I like choosing my coffee maker.” I fired back, sharing her playful tone.\n\n“Yet, here you are, hiring a woman to pick out everything in your entire house.”  She said with a cute wink. \n\n“Can’t argue that,” I chuckled, “First time I’ve ever paid someone to spend my money for me.  How much do I owe you anyway?\n\n“Oh, we can discuss it over dinner.”  She said casually as if we had planned such an event. \n\n“Dinner?”\n\n“Well yeah,”"," she said, taking a step closer, “You have me working on a Friday evening.  That’s serious overtime right there.”\n\n“Alright, let’s go. Steak?”  I asked, testing to see how serious she was.\n\n“I was thinking Italian,” she said with a smile, “I know an adorable place out by the lake.”  \n\n“Sounds expensive.”\n\n“Overtime ain’t cheap, cutie, you’re driving.”  She said, already walking toward the front door. \n\n*“Well, I’ll be damned.”*  I thought.  *“Got a date with a beautiful woman and"," didn’t even have to come up with a shitty pickup line.”*  Life was turning out alright after all.\n\nWe hopped in my truck and started driving off, but out of the corner of my eye, I saw something out of place.  A child, staring out from a window on the main floor.  I hit the brakes and turned my full attention to the window, where there was no longer a child but the drapes were swaying slightly as they had just been moved. \n\n“Are you okay?”  Rachel asked, staring at me intently.\n\n“Yeah,"," I just thought I saw a Coyote is all.”  I lied, not wanting to look like an idiot on our date.\n\n“Yeah, you’ll be seeing a few of those in this neck of the woods.”  She said with another soft laugh.  With that, I put the child out of my thoughts, my foot on the gas, and started driving.  \n\n************* Later that evening *************\n\nThe evening was wonderful, one of the best nights I’d had in a long time.  The last decade of my life had been consumed by working and saving.","  Long grueling days in remote locations left little time for romance, but that’s where the money was and money was the goal.  I hadn’t spent much time worrying about finding a partner, but after that date, I couldn’t help but wonder if maybe I’d found her anyway.  I hoped she felt the same.\n\nWe’d just met, of course, and had only one date, but I was smitten.  I reasoned with myself that I was setting down roots anyhow.  I had my welding business which was going great, a reasonable"," work/life schedule, and finally my house.  Maybe having someone to share it all with wouldn’t be so bad.  \n\nI was just drifting off to sleep, thoughts of Rachel on my mind when the pitter-patter of bare feet hitting the hardwood floors resonated throughout the house.  I sat up in bed quickly putting my feet on the carpeted floor and froze, listening intently and wondering if I’d really heard that.  Nothing but the silence was audible.  I took a deep breath to calm my heart rate,"," told myself I must have dreamed it, and started to lay back down.\n\nThe pitter-patter came again, unmistakably the sound of quick footsteps running through my hallway, right past my bedroom door.  My heart rate skyrocketed as I lurched out of bed, grabbed the pistol from my nightstand drawer, and rushed out the door ready to confront an intruder.  I turned the flashlight attachment on which illuminated the hallway in the direction the footsteps ran toward, but there was nothing"," but a wall in that direction.  \n\nI turned the light in the other direction toward the living area, walking down the hallway with the pistol held in front of me.  “WHO’S THERE?”  I yelled, unsure of what to do.  I flipped the lights on as I entered the open living area, revealing that like the hallway, it remained empty.  I continued through the main level of the house, flipping on every light as I went through.  Then I did the same with the basement, which was also empty.  \n\nThe"," last room in the basement was the laundry room.  It was large for a laundry room, but designed to double as a storage area.  For now, the mounted shelves stood empty leaving the stainless steel washer and dryer as the only things in the room.  I had cheaped out on this room, and instead of tile, I had ordered Pergo flooring to be installed.  Still, the soft grey flooring matched the rest of the house.  The room was empty, but as I turned to walk out, the light flickered, then"," went out entirely.\n\n*“Nope.”*  I thought to myself.  The thing with the lights was too weird.  I turned to walk out, but as I did so I felt a tingle on the back of my neck as if someone was right behind me, breathing on my neck and waiting to lurch.  I felt goosebumps grow on the back of my neck from a cold puff of air that touched my neck as if someone's icy breath had just touched me.  I gathered my guts and span around half expecting to be greeted by somebody, or *something*,"," despite knowing that the room was empty.  The room was indeed still empty, but that did little to qualm the feeling of being stalked.  I turned and sprinted back up the stairs, two at a time.\n\nI locked my bedroom door and sat propped up on my bed, leaving my bedroom lights on.  My breathing was heavy and chest tight as I tried desperately to make sense of it all, telling myself that I had imagined it, I dreamed it.  I definitely heard something but it definitely wasn’t real. "," Did it sound, childlike?  Raccoons, it had to be raccoons.  They must have nested somewhere before all the doors and windows were in place, right?  I pulled the covers over my head, like a child afraid of the boogeyman.\n\n*************  The Following Day *************\n\nI woke up Saturday morning with the sun already blasting the large, eastward-facing bedroom windows.  The bedroom lights were still on, and I was shocked to feel the weight of my pistol still in my hand. \n\nI cursed"," myself, for having been so scared, so damn stupid, as to drift off to sleep with a loaded weapon in my hand.  People have shot themselves in their sleep before, their fingers snagging on the trigger while they rolled over, unconsciously searching for a more comfortable position.  I cursed myself for risking my life over a raccoon, a goddamned raccoon, as I gently placed the weapon back in the quick access gun safe I kept in my nightstand drawer.  \n\nI didn’t have too much time"," to quibble with myself over the previous night's events, though, I had to get ready for the housewarming party I planned for my family, and I needed to show off.  \n\nBefore hopping in the shower, I checked my cell to see a text from Rachel.  \n\n*“Good morning, Nick!”*  It read, *“I had a great time last night.  Good luck with your housewarming party!”*  \n\nA smile grew on my face.  I immediately forgot about the raccoon fiasco, my thoughts changing course to the date with Rachel.","  After dinner, we had taken a long stroll down by the lake and talked well into the dark hours.  I don’t normally open up about my disparate family dynamic to people, but holding her soft hand in mine gave me a giddiness enough to open my mental flood gates and spill my personal details.  Somehow, we had explained much about our life stories to each other with ease, finding many similarities between our upbringings.  \n\nI’d thought about asking her to come but felt that it might"," be too much after only one date.  I had done so little dating in my adult life that I wasn't quite sure what a normal flow should be in a romantic relationship, but I did think that we were starting one.  Besides, subjugating her to deal with my step-family seemed cruel.  So instead, I resent a text message returning her thoughts about having a great time with the date, and added that I hoped we could do it again soon. \n\n************* Later that afternoon *************\n\nI had"," just finished setting up the large Charcuterie board, arranged based on a picture Rachel had sent me when the doorbell rang.  I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and opened the door with a fake smile. \n\n “Good to see you, Nicholas.”   My step-sister said with an equally fake smile, holding some sort of casserole over her pregnant belly.\n\n“Thanks for coming, Abeline.”  I returned as I held the door open for the parade of her 3 kids aged 6, 4, and 2.  Her tired-looking husband,"," Brad, held up the rear of the formation holding a stained diaper bag.  Seeing that My stepbrother, Joshua, was rolling down the street in his silver minivan, I kept the door open.  \n\n“It’s a little big for someone without any kids, don’t you think?”  Abeline said In the voice one makes when they are trying to mask their condescending judgment with a compliment.  The blows were being thrown early, but it was my day to show off.  I refused to let Abeline take that from me.\n\n“Nope,”","  I said, not having to fake my grin this time.  “I enjoy the space, and *if *I do decide to have kids, this way they won’t be stuck sharing rooms.”  Her fake smile dropped at this low blow, taking the subtle hit about how she would soon have a family of 6 living in a 3 bedroom suburban townhouse.  \n\n“Tennessee vs Georgia is on.”  I said, tossing Brad the remote, “I have all the games though, feel free to pick whatever.  \n\n“Sup man,” said Josh as he walked in with his wife and"," two kids in Tow.\n\n“Hey Man, Brad’s getting the game on, food is on the counter, and there are some new toys in the basement for the kids.”  Josh and I didn’t bother trying to fake kind formalities the way Abeline does.  At the mention of toys, the herd of kids rushed to the basement to see what wonders I had purchased to keep them entertained.  All of the kids enjoyed Uncle Nick, much to their parent's dismay.\n\nIt’s stupid and weird, the way we all act like a happy normal family,"," despite the obvious disdain we feel for each other.  But, we did it for the sake of our parents.  After my mom died from cancer in 2002, my dad had become a “born again Christian,” and married Joann, a prudent widow from his congregation.  Within 18 months of my mother’s death, I was forced into a step-family with a prude woman and her two prude children. \n\nJoann and her children always looked down on me.  She treated me as a second-class citizen compared to her two children whom"," she regarded as Angels.  They had good grades and stood out as faithful members of the congregation at their private religious school.  Meanwhile, I was lucky enough to have been kicked out of the school after slipping a Korn album into the CD player before the Easter choir program the poor children were forced to sing in.\n\nJoann had found my CD stash after Josh snitched and told her where I hid them.  She made me watch as she broke them all, but being expelled meant I was gloriously"," reunited with my friends at the public school.\n\nWhile my step-siblings made honors and memorized their bible verses, I kept my grades just good enough to stay on the wrestling team and spent my offseason skateboarding.  Joann and her church taught me that to be happy and successful I had to go straight to college, go to church, get married, and have babies.  Metal and skateboarding taught me to stick a finger to those assholes and do it my own way.  Wrestling taught me that hard"," work is the avenue to success.  \n\nInstead of going to college at the sacrifice of student loans and my dad’s retirement like Abeline and Joshua, I worked roofing during the day to pay for Welding technical school at night.  After getting my certifications debt-free, I took welding work on the pipelines for a couple of years before taking Department of Defense contracts overseas.  While my step-siblings were graduating college with student debt, getting married, and barely making"," ends meet after the cost of children, I was stacking my bank account. \n\nSure the work was grueling, and the quality of life welding in the Middle East was less than substandard, but I worked hard and was good at my job.  Josh used his degree in business to become the manager of a tire store, and Abeline put her $25,000 piece of paper degree on the wall and became a stay-at-home mom.  Meanwhile, I made a triple-digit salary with my cost of living being almost nil.  I put almost"," every dollar away in savings and investments that stacked up quickly.  \n\nFinally, 15 months ago I came back home and started my own business, which was taking off.  Now, I had my 3 employees work the shitty hours on the pipelines while I handled the work that could be done in-shop.  I did this all without wasting money on college or time at church.  That’s why I built such a nice house I didn’t need, to say fuck you to everybody who doubted me.  To let them know I did it my way"," and did it better.  \n\n“Nick!  The house looks amazing, congratulations!”  This time I didn’t have to fake the smile on my face.  I turned and gave my dad a big hug, happy to finally hear someone be genuinely happy for me.  In my late teen years and early 20s, we hadn’t talked much, but in the past 4 years, we managed to put the past behind us and forgive each other.  Now, we spend every other weekend fishing. \n\n“Thanks, Dad,” I said, before seeing Joann’s fake smile behind him.","  \n\n“It’s a little big for someone without kids, don’t you think?”  Joann asked.  Like mother, like daughter.  \n\nBefore I could come up with anything to fire back with, Abigail (Abeline’s oldest child) tapped me on the elbow.  \n\n“Uncle Nick, I thought you didn’t have any kids.”  She phrased the statement as if it was a question.  \n\n“I don’t,”  I told her, crouching down to make better eye contact with her.  \n\n“Then who’s the little girl downstairs?” \n\n“What little girl?”  I asked,"," “The only kids here are your cousins and siblings”\n\n“No, there’s a little girl in the laundry room.  She keeps crying.”  \n\nI shuddered at the mention of the laundry room.  Under normal circumstances, it would have been much easier to chalk this up to the imagination, but I was still haunted by a bad feeling deep in my chest about what happened the night before.  \n\n“I promise you, there’s nobody in there,”  I told her, pushing any doubts to the corner of my mind.  \n\n“But there"," is, I saw her!”  Abby insisted, getting frustrated that I didn’t believe her.  \n\n“Okay,” I said before her mother could intervene, “let’s go take a look.”  \n\nShe grabbed my hand and led me downstairs, her parents following behind.\n\n“See, no one here!”  I told her, secretly relieved.  \n\n“But she was right there!  Abby insisted, pointing to the corner furthest from the door, “right there!”  \n\nI was at a loss for words, not sure how to explain this away.  The chance to attempt an"," explanation was taken away from me anyhow, as Abeline started scolding her daughter.  She went off on something about making up stories, but I wasn’t listening because, for a split second, I thought I heard the faint crying of a little girl.  \n\n************* Later that night *************\n\nThe one nice thing about my step-family is that nobody overstays their welcome.  By 3:30 in the afternoon, everybody had left and I collapsed on my couch with a beer in my left hand and a phone"," in my right.  I’d asked Rachel to stop by and finish off the charcuterie that had been barely touched by my family, but unfortunately, she was obligated to family dinner.  Although I wanted to see her, I couldn't complain about an evening spent watching football and drinking a few beers.  \n\nBut before I got too comfortable, I went downstairs and tucked away all of the toys the children had enjoyed.  Cars and barbies were strewn all over the basement, but I was happy to see that"," the kids had dived into the books I had purchased as well.  Their books at home were largely religious-based, I figured they’d enjoy a couple of books about farts and such.  \n\nI shoved everything into storage underneath the stairs.  The rocking horse barely fit through the door because it was so large.  It hadn’t been cheap, but the kids had absolutely loved it, making it worth every penny. \n\nBefore I headed up the stairs, I stopped and stared at that laundry room.  I didn’t want"," to admit it, but the room exuded a sort of feeling that I couldn’t quite put my finger on.  It just felt wrong.  Even looking at the room from a distance left me feeling uneasy and creeped out.  It was more than just the weird experiences that both Abigail and I had, it was a feeling of hellish dread that seemed to emanate from the room.  I hurried over and closed the door before quickly moving up the stairs.\n\nI had a dream that night, at least I *thought* it was a dream, where"," I found myself in the basement washroom.  It was crying that had drawn me to the room, the crying of a child.  She was in the corner, wearing white pajamas with pink unicorns.  She was sitting down, her legs crossed in front of her.  Her head was buried in her hands, with her long brown hair draped over her in a tangled mess.  She was sobbing uncontrollably.\n\nI’m no expert in kids, but I guessed her to be 6 or 7 years old.  I knelt behind her and put a soft hand on her shoulder.","  At my touch, she flinched and stiffened up, as if bracing for a hit.\n\n“Heyyy, it’s okay, I'm not here to hurt you. Maybe I can help you.  What’s the matter?  I told her in the most soothing, non-threatening manner that I could.  \n\nShe loosened some at the sound of my voice but continued to cry with soft sobs. \n\n“I’m stuck here.” She said between sobs.\n\n“What do you mean you’re stuck here?  How’d you get here anyway?”  I asked.\n\n“The bad man brought me here, and we can’t leave.","  We’re stuck here with the scary thing.”  She burst into another round of sobs.\n\n“What do you mean you’re stuck?”  I asked, ignoring all of the other nagging questions. “Maybe I can help you,” I added reassuringly.\n\nAt that, she stopped crying and turned her head to face me.  “You can help me?” She asked, now facing me with her hair obscuring most of her face. \n\n“Of course,” I said warmly.  I reached up and brushed the hair away from her face, but immediately pulled back when"," I saw it.  I tried not to show the horror and disgust I felt, but that was nearly impossible.  Her face was battered, bruised, swollen, and misshapen so horribly that I couldn’t get a single idea of what she actually looked like.  She looked as if she had been ruthlessly beaten.  Her swollen neck displayed deep bruising in rings completely circling her neck. \n\n“Please,” she said again, grabbing my hand as she started to cry again, “Please you have to help me.  You have to help"," PLEASE?!”\n\nBefore I could get a grip on myself and think of something to say, the lights in the room went out.  With the darkness, a cold fell on the room, the kind of cold you’d expect to feel outside on a cold winter night.\n\nI heard something walk-up behind me and felt it too.  It was a presence, a cold, dark, evil presence. \n\nThe girl screamed so loud it hurt my ears.  Behind me, I heard laughter, a deep maniacal laughter \n\n“NO!” She screamed as the laughing intensified.\n\n“NO,"," NO NO NO!  HELP!  HEEEEELLLLPPP!”\n\nThat’s when I woke up.  I rubbed my eyes, scared, but relieved that it was only a dream.  My relief didn’t last long, however, as I realized that I was not in my bed nor was I on my couch.  I was on the floor of the laundry room.  \n\nAt the realization, I jumped to my feet and hurried to the light switch nearly slamming into the wall.  I felt along the wall frantically searching for the light switch that seemed to no longer be there.  At last,"," I found the light switch and flipped the lights on immediately pushing out the darkness.\n\nThere was no little girl, no terrifying laughter.  But there was the rocking horse, the one I had put under the stairs only hours ago. \n\n*************  The Following Day *************\n\nI hadn’t slept at all after waking up on the laundry room floor.  After that dream, which I was not sure was an actual dream) I felt genuinely shaken up.  To be completely honest, I was scared and more than"," just a little bit.  Too many strange things had happened in my home in such little time.  I tried to reason with myself, that everything had a logical explanation.  This house was brand spanking new, it couldn’t be haunted, could it?  But In my heart I knew something unexplainable was taking place, I could feel it. \n\nRachel was on her way, though, which granted me a welcome distraction.  We had plans to make and eat breakfast together.  The text she sent telling me that she was"," on her way brought a smile to my face, and I immediately pushed aside my fear because I needed to freshen up.  I had a lady to impress. \n\n“So, Nick, how are you settling in with this handsome house?” Rachel asked as we sipped our second or third serving of mimosas.  The golden morning sun shone through the large windows that faced the rear of the home, warmly illuminating the home in such a way that made it hard to believe the unsettling experiences I'd had. \n\n“Ya know, it - it’s"," great,” I said, my mind involuntarily moved to the incident with the little girl, but I didn’t want to sound like an idiot.  “Really I'm surprised every time I see it, it seems too beautiful to be mine.”\n\n“Why’d you hesitate?” she asked.\n\n“What do you mean?”\n\n“You hesitated.  Is there something that you don’t like about the house?” \n\n“No no, it’s just that..”  I trailed off, not sure if I wanted to finish the sentence.  \n\n“Tell me!”  Rachel insisted, slamming the table in a pretend"," show of aggressive frustration.\n\n“I think this house is haunted,” I blurted out.  \n\n“But it’s brand new,” Rachel returned looking more serious this time.  \n\n“I know how that sounds,” I said, putting my hands up as if surrendering, “but hear me out.\n\nI proceeded to tell Rachel everything, starting at the beginning with the time I saw a child peering out the window as we left for our date.  I told her about the footsteps I sometimes heard at night, about the crying girl my niece"," insisted she had seen, and finally about the weird “dream” I had before waking up in the laundry room. \n\nI finished the story while Rachel listened intently.  I paused, worried that she’d think me crazy and make an excuse to leave, but her response was nothing of the sort. \n\n“I believe you.” She said, putting down her glass.\n\nI let out the breath that I hadn’t realized that I was holding in, relieved to find a serious but reassuring look on her face.\n\n“I saw a girl too, on the"," day you moved in.  I blew it off and kept telling myself that it was some sort of illusion, but I haven’t been able to let it go.”  She put her hand to her head as if experiencing a serious headache.  “It just felt so, well, creepy.  I don’t know how else to put it.”\n\nA small smile crept on my face.  I was aware that the smile was out of place, but I found it strangely touching to know that I wasn’t alone in these strange, even dark, experiences.  Rachel looked at me confused"," for a moment before she also smiled and we both broke into a weird fit of anxious laughter.  \n\n“My brand new house is Haunted,”  I said after getting a hold of myself and finding a more serious tone.  “I’ll be honest, I’m scared of my house.” \n\n“Well,” Rachel started, with her flirtatious glint reappearing In her eye, “Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad if you weren’t sleeping alone.”\n\n“I think you might be right,” I laughed, “But I’m not sure my bed is big enough, maybe we should go"," make sure my bed will fit us both.”  \n\nThe bed, as it turns out, was plenty big (and sturdy) enough for the both of us.\n\n*************Two Weeks Later *************\n\nI had woken up around 1:00 AM to the pitter-patter of feet running throughout the house, an occurrence that had happened often to both myself and Rachel over the previous 2 weeks.  We’d both heard crying a time or two, and had just ignored it.  The toys that I had kept stored underneath the stairs were often found"," scattered around the basement.  Although somewhat creepy, I had decided to just let it happen.\n\nRachel had stayed over most nights, which was great for many reasons.  I’d sometimes wondered if things were moving too fast, but it was working great and I’m not one to argue with a good thing.  Besides, I felt much more at ease not being alone at night, and I began to think that maybe I could get used to living in a haunted house.  I reasoned with myself that it was just a child ghost"," after all, and what harm could a child be?\n\nDespite that, I couldn’t escape the disconcerting question as to why a child would be haunting my house?  The house was brand new, there were no previous occupants to have died in the home.  Rachel and I theorized that perhaps there had been a car accident on the road resulting in the death of a child, but had not been able to find any corroborating evidence while searching the news archives. \n\nThat particular night, however, it felt"," different.  Usually, it was just a sound that I could blow off and go back to sleep, allowing the sound to be filtered out with the background noise. Instead, I felt an intrusive sense of fear, dread, and sorrow that held me tight to the bed and threatened tears as I suddenly wanted to cry.  I wanted to move, but the weight of fear pinned me to the mattress.\n\nI heard a whisper, in the voice of a scared child, say, “Please, please help me.”\n\nThe whisper in my ear was enough to"," overcome my paralyzing fear and jolt me to my feet.  I had to get away from, whatever was going on, the way you feel the need to get away from a bee buzzing in your ear. \n\nI walked quickly, but quietly, to the master bedroom where I splashed water on my face.  The soothing touch of the cold water shocked my senses but helped bring me back to reality.  It was probably just a dream, another creepy dream brought to me courtesy of my creepy house.  My chest expanded as I inhaled a"," deep comforting breath, then relaxed as my chest pushed the breath out allowing me to open my eyes. \n\nMy heart plunged into my kidney the second I opened my eyes.  There was someone (or maybe I should say some*thing*) standing directly behind me.  The monstrous thing was humanoid in form, but there is no way it could be called Human.  It towered above me, standing so tall that its head was nearly touching the ceiling.  Although it was dark, I could see that its skin was composed"," of a blotchy black and red, yet slightly translucent plastic-like substance that reminded me of dirty Saran Wrap. \n\nI desperately wanted to run, or scream or anything besides just standing there, but I once again found myself held tight with paralyzing fear.  Although it had no iris nor pupils to be seen, I felt its empty white eyes staring madly into mine.  The thing leaned forward until its head was just above mine in the reflection and placed a hand on my shoulder.  The hand"," was so cold that it burned as if my skin had encountered dry ice.  My reaction was to pull away from the pain, but I couldn’t, I was paralyzed and not just by fear.  Some force had stolen my ability to move, I found myself unable to so much as grimace at the pain in my shoulder.\n\nThe hideous beast smiled at me in a threatening fashion, exposing black gums with only a handful of long grey teeth.  It winked at me, as if to say, *“There’s nothing you can do to stop me,”* and then"," it was gone.  \n\nThe weight was lifted from my shoulder and the burning stopped.  I dared an attempt to wiggle my fingers and found that I had regained the freedom to move of my own free will.  I had just enough time to turn on the light before the screaming started.  \n\nPiercing screams of intense fear and agony exploded through the house, dicing the eerie silence of the night.  My first thought was of Rachel, so I burst back into the room to find her still asleep, unphased by"," the horrific screams as if she could not hear them at all.  The screaming continued and my heart fell as I realized the agonizing sound was coming from the basement. \n\nI didn’t want to go, I was terrified and considered waking Rachel and vacating the damned house, but my inner conscience told me I needed to try and help the poor hurting souls, despite the fact that I hadn’t the slightest idea how to do so.  I made my decision, and without further hesitation, I hurried to the basement.\n\nAs"," I descended the stairs the screaming grew louder.  I reached the basement where I found the light in the Laundry room flickering so fast it created a strobe-like effect, casting flickering shadows across the entire basement as if a concert was playing.  I ran into the room where the toy horse was rocking violently in the middle.  Laundry detergent fell off a shelf and burst onto the floor as the screams reached an unbearable and inhuman volume, so loud it pain erupted deep inside"," my ears.  \n\nI pressed my hands to my ears squeezing so hard that it hurt my head, but it did little to vanquish the intensity of my pain.  My knees were suddenly weak as I became physically and emotionally overwhelmed and I collapsed to my knees as if the weight of my body had become too much for my shaky legs to carry.  The sound was all-encompassing, not coming from any specific part of the room but existing in all parts of the room.\n\nI squeezed my eyes shut in a feeble attempt"," to concentrate and find some sort of solution when it hit me.  The walls.  The screams were coming from the walls!\n\nBefore I understood what I was doing, I stood and slammed my fist into the wall closest to me.  My hand went straight through the drywall hitting the concrete behind it.  A pain shot through my knuckles and up through my elbow, but in the adrenaline-fueled moment I paid the pain little mind and ripped as much of the drywall out as I could.  I used the opening to"," grab more drywall and rip off piece after piece until finally, an entire board of drywall was loose.  \n\nI grabbed one more time and pulled, forcing the entire 8-foot by 4-foot section to fall.  The screaming stopped immediately, as did the strobing of the light.  For a brief moment, all was still.  The room was quiet.\n\nAfter the drywall fell, a plastic bundle fell from between the exposed framing and hit the floor with a dull thud, landing partially on my bare foot.  I was breathing"," heavily but managed to take a couple of deep breaths and regain some composure at the eerie but welcome silence.  I took a knee beside the bundle and rolled it over. \n\nWhat I found caused my heart to beat with the ferocity of a death metal drum solo that blurred my vision with every beat.  Tightly squeezed inside the layers of thick plastic was that little girl, the one I had seen crying in the basement.  Or, her body I should say.  I could see her misshapen and rotting face still"," frozen with the fear of her final moments of life.  Her brown hair, coated In decaying blood, was plastered against her face by the tightly wrapped plastic. \n\nIt took me a few moments to notice that now I was the one screaming.  I backed away, shocked by the body that had been rotting within the walls of the home I had been so proud of.  Then, the lights went out, submerging me into a pit of darkness.  The only thing I could see was the demonic beast that I had encountered earlier,"," somehow visible in the eternal darkness.  “*The Scary Thing*.”\n\nI backed away as it moved toward me, a menacing combination of amusement and hatred staining its almost-human face.  I felt my heel slip out from under me on the spilled laundry detergent.  I fell, hitting the back of my head on the washer. \n\n************* A Few Minutes Later *************\n\nI regained consciousness outside the house, where I found myself on a stretcher being pushed down the driveway.  Flashing red"," and blue lights reflected off the white exterior of the home, illuminating it in a daunting fashion.  It reminded me of the day I was given the keys, and I once again found the house to appear daunting and secretive.  I knew that what I had just uncovered was only a scratch on the surface of the hellish secrets contained in that home.\n\nA sobbing and exasperated Rachel was explaining what had happened to a shocked-looking officer as more patrol cars raced down the street.  He looked"," to be about my age, old enough to have some solid experience under his belt.  But the look on his face showed that no amount of training and experience could have prepared him for this.\n\nDespite the chaos, I felt at ease.  Somehow I knew that it was over, for that little girl at least.  She’d asked for help, begged for it, and I thought that maybe I had given her the help she needed.  The help she deserved.\n\nThe next few nights were a nightmare of a different sort.  I repeatedly"," gave careful statements to the police, trying to describe how I came to find a body in the walls of my house In the middle of the night without raising suspicion or sounding crazy. \n\nThey had searched my house for more bodies, thankfully there were none.  What they did find, though, was a large pentagram along with other demonic symbols painted underneath the flooring.  \n\nThe General Contractor of the house had been brought in for questioning, who quickly admitted that because"," I had picked cheaper finishing for the room, he had hired some guy off the classifieds and paid him under the table.  DNA evidence found on the body matched multiple crimes across the country, and the Contractor was able to successfully ID the same man in a photo lineup.  \n\nThe going theory is that this man performed some sort of satanic sacrifice in the night when nobody else was around.  He then covered it up with the flooring and by hiding the body in the wall.  The little"," girl had been kidnapped from her home in a different state 6 months prior, which meant he kept her for several months before killing her.\n\nThe worst part is, they have only a photo of this man, no name or solid information to be found.  Nobody knows exactly who he is, why he did what he did, or where he is now.\n\nHe’s still out there, and I know without a doubt, that he’ll kill again.\n\n[RMS](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorsOfStaniforth/)"],"title":"I built a BRAND NEW house, but it was Haunted as Fuck."},{"content":["There’s a song you need to hear.

Every so often i would go to second hand stores to find something that was still in good condition, but wasn't that pricey.\n\nAfter i started college, i needed to move to a different region and so i couldn't quite go to the same store, as it was an about 2 hours drive. I was online after school one day, when i stumbled upon this ad for \"Cheap high-quality clothes\" and it also said that it was made from \"recycled material\", whatever that meant."," I looked a bit through the photos they posted online and it al seemed too good to be true.\n\nI looked up the adress and it was just 2 blocks away from the college campus. I still had time until the sun went down, so i figured i would pay a visit to whoever owned the store. I took my jacket and headed out the door. I slowly made my way to the store, and at first i didn't notice the entrance. Then i looked for any sign that indicated that the store was here. There was this graffiti"," sprayed on the side of the building in red: \"second hand store\", with an arrow pointing downward .\n\nI turned the corner and saw that the store itself was below ground level, with a narrow staircase leading down. I went down and opened the door to be met with a wierd sight. The racks of the clothes were all aligned with the walls and in the very center of the room, there was this guy with a disturbing look on his face.\n\n\"Good afternoon\" i politely said.\n\"Good afternoon\" he responded,"," without much emotion.\n\nThen he just went in the back of the store and told me to call for him when i was done. He left and i started looking through the racks of clothing. \n\nFirst thing i noticed was that the clothes weren't sorted and on every rack you would find anything from skirts to shirts. Second thing was that the clothes weren't particularly interesting, but some looked pretty wierd. For example, there was a purse that looked to be covered with fur, which itself was pretty"," long. \n\nIt honestly looked like a DIY job rather than some fashion brand. Still, i brushed it of as being someone's experiment, took a few large pairs of pants and some T-shirts i liked and called for the man. I need to mention also that the materials of the clothes didn't look ordinary. For example the \"jeans\" felt like they were being made from a material that seemingly tried to imitate the material it looked like, which is jeans. The T-shirts also had this feeling. \n\nHe quickly"," came back and told me how much it costed. I was suprised as to how cheap they were, but i assumed just that many people wanted to donate their clothes to the shop and the ones that i picked up just so happened to be the ones he was trying to get rid of. I payed and went home. \n\nFor the next 3 months i didn't go to that shop, but winter was approaching and i needed to get some warmer clothes. Just as i was about to leave the house, i got a call from my cousin. She said that she"," was coming to pay a surprise visit to me and that she was already on her way here, with about half an hour left. \n\nI decided to put my shopping trip on pause, as i always took a longer time finding winter clothes and i didn't want my cousin to arrive while i was gone. So i waited and waited and it was already about 10 pm when i decided to call my family to ask whether my cousin was really coming. \n\nThey said they hadn't spoken to her since she left, but she assured them she was"," coming to meet me. I thought that maybe she stopped for the night at a motel and tomorrow morning she would pay me a visit. So i went to bed. \n\nNext day i was woken up by my cell phone ringing. It was the police.

I walked inside and started looking through the clothing items. \n\nSomething was odd though. Many items were with the same color: a pale beige. I was looking through the racks and then saw something familiar, but i couldn't"," place my finger on it. Then i understood: the items i was looking at were a pair of beige gloves, with a brown spot on one of the fingers: it looked exaclty like my cousin's birthmark and placement of it. \n\nI ran so fast that i slipped on the floor and fell near the shoes under the clothing racks and my body left my soul: a pair of shoes with eyes on them. I recognized them: they were definitely my cousin's eyes . \n\nSuddenly the man came out of the back room and i sprinted to"," the door. I ran until i reached my campus.

The passage of time had slowed to an agonizing"," crawl, giving the impression of much longer. \n\n\n\"There's nothing left for me out there.\" I affirmed in the mirror, my daily mantra, as if trying to convince someone other than myself. \n\n\n\"Nothing at all.\"\n\n\nI peeked out through the blinds and watched a former neighbor shuffle down the street in a monstrous, shambling gait. The mangled stump of its foot dragged listlessly behind as it sluggishly made its way round the bend into the next neighborhood and out of sight.

Their bizarre mating call blared out into the otherwise dead twilight, rending me from any peaceful sleep I may have possibly enjoyed.

A bloodcurdling wailing of ecstatic starved hunger. \n\n\nThey called me mad when I began fortifying my home, all the"," locks and shutters. Well, who's mad now? The shriekers, that's who.

A thick sliver of disgust shone through the terror as my jittering hands fumbled with the lid on the petrol canister. I regained some composure as I focused on my mission. It spun off, clanking against the cold metal body of its host noisily, I swallowed a lump in my throat as I reassured myself that I was still as of yet undetected. \n\n\nI attached the plastic hose and the pungent liquid flowed freely through"," the thin metal letterbox. I made sure to be quick about it, one slip up and it'd all be over. They'd be on me like wild dogs to a feast. The canister ran dry, now the lighter. I flicked its ignition repeatedly before finally striking flame, one last look around and in it went. \n\n\nThe house immediately erupted in flames and I retreated back to safety, desperate to get inside before the swarm arrived to salvage its sickening brood. I observed half in glee and half in a growing dread"," as the nest was engulfed. Then just as expected, they arrived. Their awful wailing tearing through the night. I shuddered as I closed the blinds, hoping this would at the very least thin out their numbers, if not force them to move on from the area entirely. How I longed for the day when I could venture out without fear of an attack, to rebuild, and restock my ever dwindling supplies. The start of a whole new world, a better world, like the old one. My eyes began to close as I"," fell into a deep sleep, the shrieking outside now just  a familiar white noise of sorts, lulling me.\n\n\nI awoke to a loud banging on the front door. They'd found me.

It had been a poor hunting season and with the bulk of the winter still to come, rations were low. I would need to go to town. I didn’t look forward to that. I rolled a strip of jerky and let it sit between my teeth and the inside of my cheek like a piece of hard candy. Had to make it last. \n\nWinter nights are long and cold this far north. On clear moonlit nights the carpet of snow on the forest floor glows. Birch trees wearing jackets of"," white cast shadows as if under sunlight. The stars shine bright and turn on a wheel with the North Star at the centre.\n\nIt was not so the first night I encountered the creature. Weather came in from the south and dark clouds lingered into the night and blacked out the moon and the stars. From the window of my cabin, halfway up the mountain and deep in the forest, the outside world was a deep black. Fading embers in the pot belly stove cast a pale glow on the timber walls.\n\nI heard"," the drone of the engine first. A snowmobile. It’s rare for anyone to come this far up the mountain, especially at night. You first have to cross the small lake between the forest and the town, which freezes each winter, and then thread a path uphill through the trees. It was bad enough under moonlight let alone on a night like this where the forest was an impenetrable black mass. \n\nLights flickered through the window and were gone again. I rose from my bed and wiped away the condensation"," on the glass. Headlights cut through the darkness and the engine rose and fell as the driver dodged the trees. The engine idled for a moment and laughter and shouting filled the night air. The engine revved once more and drowned out the voices.\n\n“Kids,” I said.\n\nBoxer raised his head at my voice and lowered it back to his bed of blankets. \n\n“Don’t pay them any mind, they’ll soon get tired of it and go back home. That or they’ll make friends with a tree.”\n\nThe snowmobile droned"," on, sometimes quiet and far away and sometimes loud and close by. With it the laughing and shouting carried on. I figured they were drunk and out joyriding. I could think of a long list of better things to do on a Saturday night. But that’s how it is up north, you make entertainment with what you have at your disposal. \n\nThere’s not much to Canary Hill. Few people can pinpoint it on a map. If they’ve heard of it at all, they know little more than it is up north. Somewhere up there,"," isolated and frozen, and surrounded by jagged snow-covered peaks. \n\nThe town was built to support a now defunct coal mine. Houses with weathered sidings and flaking paint line grids of dirt roads. The town might have died when the mine was shuttered, but instead Canary Hill became a tourist destination. People come in winter to see the Northern Lights or to take excursions by sled or snowmobile to the frozen lakes to fish for salmon, trout and Arctic char. In summer they come"," to see a sun that never sets and the fishing, but now by boat. The old miner’s huts in town are now bed and breakfasts and new custom-built hotels with glass ceilings come with $300 a night price tags. \n\nThe whine of the snowmobile heightened to a squeal. Boxer gave a low growl and trotted to the cabin door. He thrust his snout to the small gap at the bottom of the door and sniffed. He took in the information on the air and turned his white head to me and growled once more. He"," scratched at the door with a paw and pleaded with blue eyes common to the husky breed.\n\n“We aren’t going out there. It’s only kids.”\n\nBoxer’s growl turned to a high-pitched whine.\n\n“Quiet.”\n\nBoxer fell silent and so did the night. No snowmobile engine and no voices. And then a scream. A high pitched scream lasting a few seconds followed by shouting. I rose from my bed and went to the window. Snowmobile headlights pointed away from my cabin, but the machine was still. Figures wearing"," bright puffed jackets moved in the lights and one fell in the snow. Then another scream.\n\nI took my jacket off the hook and put on my boots and slung my rifle over my shoulder. I grabbed my old miner’s helmet with a light mounted to the top and pressed it down over my woollen hat. Boxer was ready at the door and I thrust it open. The cold was a slap in the face, but the night was still. The snowmobile was close and I trotted out to it, boots crunching in the snow. \n\nOne track"," of the snowmobile propped against a mound of snow at the base of a tree. The nose was dug in and half-buried. The engine was off and the occupants had left it. Two beer bottles lay discarded by a tree. Multiple sets of footprints made a confused circle beside the snowmobile and led out into the darkness. \n\nBoxer ambled ahead sniffing at the ground. I followed Boxer and the tracks and called out. The answer came in a muffled cry to my right and down the slope. A small light bobbed"," in the darkness. Someone was running using a phone for a torch. I shone my torch in their direction and Boxer ran on ahead following the beam of light. A girl with dark hair and a red puffer jacket appeared, her hair caked in snow and her eyes wide. Her skin shone pale in the torch light.\n\n“Come quick,” she said. “Something is out there.”\n\nHer words came in fits of short breaths. I knew the girl. Her name was Talia. She turned and ran back into the forest retracing her footsteps"," in the snow. I ran after her, the light on my helmet lighting her way. Boxer ran ahead, slowing on occasion to sniff at the ground. He stopped and turned a circle and looked back and waited. \n\nBeside Boxer a boy lay on his back. He held his head with one hand and blood spilled from his nose forming a pool of dark red in the snow. The boy mumbled something but I could not make it out. Boxer had no interest in the bleeding boy and barked out into the darkness. \n\n“It’s trying to"," take him,” Talia said.\n\n“Trying to take who?”\n\n“Steven. Steven is out there.”\n\n“What was it, a bear?” I thought it unlikely. We did get bears, but it was too late in winter for them to be out roaming in the night. \n\n“I don’t know.”\n\nI shone the light in the direction Boxer was facing and caught a glimpse of a person ahead. I took my rifle in my hands and edged forward. Boxer followed at my heels. \n\nI kept the light on the figure, a kid standing out in the snow. A strange warmth"," grew as we neared. It was as if a fire burned somewhere, but I saw no flame. I crept through the snow making as little noise as possible.\n\nThe kid was close now, a boy in a dark grey jacket facing into the darkness ahead. He turned his head and looked into the light of the torch. His face was shrouded in darkness as if he wore a black hood. From the top of his head a strip of black about the diameter of a forearm stretched out and snaked its way into the dark of the woods beyond."," The black strip writhed and jerked in the still night air. \n\n“It wants me to go with it,” the boy said.\n\nHe expelled puffs of black smoke from his mouth as he spoke. I focused the torch on the head of the boy and saw dozens of thinner black cords as if an octopus had wrapped its tentacles around him. The tentacles pulsed and slithered and held the boy fast. One disappeared up each nostril and several entered his open mouth and hissed like air releasing from a tyre as they injected"," black smoke into him. The left eye of the boy was visible and reflected back the torchlight.\n\n“You’re ok,” I said. “Why don’t you come with me?” I held out my hand to the boy.\n\n“It wants me to go. And I want to go. I won’t let you stop me.”\n\nThe boy turned his body to face me and he started to walk toward me. I lowered my rifle.\n\n“That’s it,” I said.\n\nThe boy reached out and gripped the rifle and tried to wrestle it from me. I closed both hands on the rifle and gave the boy a"," shove with my forearm. He staggered back a few steps and then came at me. I raised my rifle.\n\n“Stop right there.”\n\nThe boy did not stop. Boxer began barking wildly. I backed up a couple of steps. The trees rustled behind the boy. The warmth I had felt turned to a wave of heat. It was like standing beside a roaring bonfire and yet there was still no flame. Two glowing orbs appeared from behind a tree. I turned my torso to point the torch into the trees behind the boy and I caught"," the edge of a black mass behind a thick tree trunk. Something was there.\n\nI stumbled backward and fell to the snow. The boy turned and walked to the creature hiding in the trees. It extended a limb and a set of long fingers wrapped around the torso of the boy and in a single motion pulled the boy up off his feet. The black tentacles circling the head of the boy released their grip and revealed eyes full of fear and a wide smile that showed all the boy’s teeth. And then with a"," flourish that left the branches swaying, the creature and the boy were gone.\n\nMy heart thumped like a cannon in my chest. I manipulated the torch to where the thing had been but there was only forest and snow. The heat I had felt was gone, replaced with the cold of night. Behind me Talia screamed. I edged forward to where the black creature had been. There was nothing. \n\n“Where did he go?” she said.\n\n“Quiet.”\n\nBoxer sniffed and I listened. Nothing. I swung the torch around but"," I caught nothing. On the ground a ring of green forest floor was visible where the creature had stood. It had melted the snow. I smelled something burning. I trained the torch on the tree trunk the creature hid behind and found black char marks on the bark. Adjacent trees also bore black marks and then the trail stopped. I slung my rifle on my shoulder and ripped off my glove and ran my hand over the tree and it was warm to the touch.\n\n“Where did it go?” I said.\n\nI swung the torch"," in a circle searching for charred trees or footprints in the snow. A trail of melted snow led deep into the forest. I followed it, part hoping I would find the boy and part hoping I would not find what had taken him. I came to an exposed ledge of rock and the trail disappeared. In the dark of the night I could not see where or if the trail continued beyond. \n\nI retraced my steps. Talia was on her knees in the snow, her head in her hands. The boy with the bloodied nose was behind"," her, standing now but bent over, his hands on his thighs. The stream of blood from his nose had slowed to a drip.\n\n“What the hell was that?” I said. \n\n“I don’t know,” Talia said.\n\n“Tell me what happened.”\n\nTalia dropped her hands. She turned to her friend and then back to me. “We were just out riding in the snow. We thought we saw lights out in the forest. We stopped and Steven went out to look. We heard him scream. We went to him but it had him. We tried to help.”\n\n“I think he"," broke my nose,” the boy said.\n\nLight snow began to fall. I placed a hand on Talia’s jacket to help her up and her friend stepped across and slapped my arm away. He eyed me as he lifted Talia to her feet. \n\n“We have to go after him,” Talia said.\n\n“He’s gone,” I said. “Wherever he is we won’t find him in the dark. One of you should call the Chief.” \n\n\\--------\n\nThe interrogation room at the police station was not new to me. At the end of the summer, a local man by the name of Lee"," Rutkowski had gone out hunting one day and never came home. He told his wife he planned to head into the woods not far from where my cabin is, so it was no surprise when they hauled me in. But I had not seen or heard Rutkowski. They never did find his body.\n\nThe chief of police is a man named Sam Fingleton, known around town as Chief. The rest of the town was on a first name basis with each other, including Fingleton’s deputies. But such was the standing Fingleton held in the"," town, everyone knew him only as Chief. Some residents would be hard pressed to tell you his first name. Not that there was ever much policing to do. The odd drunken brawl on a Friday night, and those were rarer since the coal mine shut down. Fingleton is a tall, thin man with glasses and a receding hairline. He could pass for a banker or a lawyer, but he had a hard edge to him and you had a front row seat if you ever found yourself on the wrong side of the law in Canary Hill."," \n\nFingleton stood in the corner with crossed arms while one of his deputies, a pale, stout man named Jim Elliott, took my statement. I had shown the police where the boy had stood and where the creature had been. And I’d shown them the charred trees, which I could not find an explanation for. They started their search in the night and went on into the day. Then they hauled me in.\n\n“I find it strange,” Fingleton said.\n\n“What’s that?”\n\n“All this happened up by your cabin. You’re"," the only one living out in the forest. There’s no one else on that mountain and it’s right there this boy goes missing. It’s quite a coincidence.”\n\n“I didn’t invite them over.”\n\n“Then why did they go up there?”\n\n“Why don’t you ask them?”\n\n“Why is no one giving me a straight answer? There’s a boy missing and all I’m getting is some story about black monsters spewing smoke. Why don’t you tell me what happened and this time cut the shit.”\n\n“I told you what happened. The kids will"," tell you the same.”\n\n“Except I don’t believe in fairy tale monsters. I’ve been doing this job a long time and every monster I’ve ever encountered has been human. I want you to level with me Walker.”\n\n“Everything that goes on up in those woods is not on me because I live up there. And if I was going to come up with a story I’d think of something better than monsters in the woods. Hell I’d blame it on a bear. I know how this sounds.”\n\n“Do you think it might have been a bear?” Elliott"," said.\n\n“Bears don’t move like that, nor do they melt the snow where they stand and nor do they char tree trunks when they walk by them.”\n\n“We looked in the woods,” Fingleton said, “and we didn’t find any bear or any creature that abducts teenagers.”\n\n“I can’t tell you any different than what it was.”\n\n“I had to knock on the door of that kid’s house today. The boy was Mark Potter’s kid, Steven. Mark and Jude are real cut up about him going missing.”\n\n“I didn’t know that was Potter’s"," kid.”\n\n“If the boy is still alive somewhere we need to get to him today and before it gets dark again or he won’t survive out in the cold.”\n\n“I don’t suspect he would. If I knew where he was I’d tell you. I got nothing against him. But I don’t know where he went so if you don’t have anything else I’d rather be on my way. I need to get back home before dark. The forest is no place to be wandering around after the sun goes down.”\n\n“If there is something out there,” Elliott said,"," “you still fancy being alone in your cabin with this thing running around?”\n\n“That cabin is my home and this thing being out there doesn’t change that.”\n\nFingleton sighed. “Sign your statement and get out of here. My team will be poking around out there again at first light so try not to shoot us. And don’t go making any trips south, we may want to talk to you again.”\n\n“I got no plans to be anywhere else.”\n\nElliott had tethered Boxer to a pole out front and I untied the leash"," and was on my way. I didn’t have a car, never had much use for one after I moved up into the woods, so I had to make the trip by foot. It was two minutes to the lookout at the edge of town and after a scramble down the slope and onto the lake it was another twenty minutes to the tree line. The walk took longer in the summer when the ice melted and I had to walk around the lake instead of straight across. From the tree line it was still a hike up the slope to the clearing and my"," cabin. I guessed there was two hours until dark, so there was no time to waste.\n\nThe lake was empty in the fading light of the afternoon. Anyone who might have been ice fishing had long since gone home. Up on the hill where the access track cut into the forest the police were packing up for the night. They would need to wait until morning to resume the search for the missing boy.\n\nI had almost reached the tree line when two flashlights flickered through the trees. Coming the other"," way were two men on foot. Mark Potter was one, a large man whose cheeks were almost always red, and who always wore the same trucker hat, even in the cold of winter. The other man was George Visser, who was on my crew at the mine before it closed. We buddied up when he started at the mine and he had been easy to teach. George had a bout of lung trouble and now got a pension from the government. We had a falling out years ago and no longer spoke. George had a wife who had died"," of cancer shortly after giving birth to Talia, the girl who had been on the mountain the night before.  \n\nPotter had spotted me and made a bee line through the trees and out onto the lake. He puffed out his chest and quickened his step as he neared me.\n\n“What were you doing out there Walker? I saw you get taken away by the police.” Potter said.\n\n“I didn’t have anything to do with it, I was just there.”\n\n“You saw what happened?”\n\n“I saw your boy get taken.”\n\n“Get taken by what?”"," Potter’s voice cracked on the last word.\n\n“I don’t know what it was.”\n\n“What were you doing there, hanging out with kids?”\n\n“They came my way, I didn’t go theirs. I’m sorry about your boy.”\n\n“I don’t need your sorry. I need my boy back. Where did it take him?”\n\n“I followed the tracks up the mountain, but I couldn’t find him. It was too dark. I’m sorry about your boy.” I tugged at Boxer’s leash and walked around the two men.\n\n“Your old friend George here tells me what a kook you"," are, hiding away up in the woods all on your own.”\n\nI stopped and looked back at George who avoided my gaze and looked at his own feet.\n\nPotter continued. “If you had anything to do with this I’m going to come up there and give you what’s coming.”\n\n“I have to get home, it’s getting dark.”\n\nThe route I normally took to the cabin went right by where the creature took the boy. I veered off a little to avoid it. It wasn’t so much a conscious decision, but the way my feet took me."," \n\nI had spent much of my life in the forest and I knew to be vigilant. There was always the risk of bears or a bad fall. I knew the risks, but I’d never been truly afraid. As I crossed the tree line my steps slowed and my eyes darted from side to side. Boxer, now off the leash, kept close by my side.\n\nDark clouds hung in the air and the light was fading fast. I knew the way, but in the twilight the shadows turned the forest dark and my pulse quickened. My mind played back the"," glimpse of the creature, black and waiting to pounce. The boy stood helplessly as it grabbed and took him. My walk turned to a trot and Boxer kept pace.\n\nIt was almost dark when I reached the cabin. The structure emerging from the woods filled me with relief. I stepped through the last of the trees and stopped dead. Boxer stopped with me and raised his snout and sniffed. Thick streaks of black covered the timber wall panels of the cabin. It was as if someone had taken a foot wide"," paint brush and smeared black paint over the walls. I thought back to the charred tree trunks. The creature had been here.\n\nI knew there was something out in the forest, I had seen it. But in the station, telling the story to the authorities had made it somehow distant. I let myself believe I would be safe in the small parcel I occupied, that whatever this was would leave me alone if I left it alone. The creature had not accepted the bargain. The safety of my cabin was now anything"," but.\n\nA strengthening breeze rustled through the trees. I crept to the cabin. I took off one glove and put my hand on the char mark. It was cold. The creature had been here, but it was some time ago. I jammed the key in the lock and shouldered open the door. In the last of the light I searched for any movement from within the single room. Nothing moved.\n\nI hauled some firewood inside and closed the door behind me and locked it. I lit a fire in the pot belly stove in the middle"," of the room. The cabin was cold and I held my hands out to the warmth. I put on a pan of beans and boiled some tea. I didn’t feel much like eating, but I was tired and the food would do me good. There would be no sleep tonight. The creature could come back and if it did I had to be ready. I took a rifle from the shelf and propped myself on the bed and set the rifle on my lap. Boxer turned a small circle beside the bed and I tapped on the foot of the bed and he jumped up and nestled"," against my leg. I never let him on the bed, but I let the rule slide this once.\n\nI considered hiking back to town. Outside it was dark, the clouds had thickened and all external light was gone. There was no way I wanted to make the journey back to town now. Even with a flashlight the forest had too many hiding places. Maybe if the night was clear and there was a full moon, but the sky was ink black. So, I would wait. I would wait all night with my rifle and Boxer by my side. I"," would wait for the creature to come and bang at the door.\n\n [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/SleeplessFromSundown/)"],"title":"I live in a remote cabin in the far north, something is stalking the woods"},{"content":["It was a quiet Sunday evening when I got the call.

I could faintly hear background noises at the other end of the line, though. After a long moment, a cool, businesslike voice piped up. \"Good evening.

Johnny Cash sang his heart out on the car radio as I sped through the highway on a foggy morning. The long road ran through the woods and I drove past miles and miles of"," tall birch trees that stretched up to the sky. All around me, there was nothing but forest.\n\nThe RSA Commerce warehouse was an old, empty building complex, tucked away in the middle of nowhere. It looked abandoned. I pulled up to the car park outside it.\n\nAs I stepped out of my car, I couldn't help but notice the high level of security. There were lots of security guards roaming around the facility, patrolling the area. That should have sent the alarm bells ringing. But the man"," who interviewed me had explained that my job would involve delivering confidential, high-value goods. It made sense that they'd go balls-out on the security.\n\nThe top of the market pay was enough to stop me questioning.\n\n\"It'll only be a 3-week contract,\" the man on the phone had informed me. \"Our main driver is disposed at the moment. We just need a contractor to temporarily fill his place, until we can find a permanent replacement in-house.\"\n\nThe first day went as you'd expect."," Me and my line manager had a short huddle meeting. Then, I was assigned my truck.\n\nI leaned against the hood of my car, smoking a cigarette while I waited for the box truck to be loaded. The job of loading trucks was only assigned to a select few. Once the truck was loaded, my supervisor moved it onto the road for me. He hopped out and handed me the keys, before reminding me of his warnings, tattooing the words into my memory. \"Your job is simply to drive to the destination and"," drive back here. Nothing more, nothing less,\" he cleared his throat and spat onto the ground. \"Do not, at any point, attempt to open the back of the truck. What's in there is confidential. It'll be a 3-hour drive.

Do not try to step out of the truck and help. Just stay in your seat and wait for the green light to leave.\"\n\nI was"," on the road by 7 am. The first job was a 200-mile drive to Detroit. I sipped some black coffee and listened to an *80s Greatest Hits* playlist as I made my way from Muskegon. The traffic wasn't too bad, so it was a smooth drive. When I arrived at the drop-off point, the workers signalled for me to reverse into a dimly-lit warehouse. Just as I was instructed, I waited in the driver's seat as they unloaded the truck before giving me the green light to go. Then I made my way back"," to the RSA Commerce depot.\n\nThe only time I stopped was to fuel up or take a toilet break.\n\nMy shift ended around 2 pm that day.\n\nThe schedule remained the same on most days, with the odd graveyard shift here and there. Whenever I finished a drop-off, I'd go straight home. There was never more than one drop-off per day. I was making easy money and the hours weren't too bad.\n\nEverything was going well until I started hearing thuds from the back of my truck one night.\n\nI still remember"," that night like it was yesterday. It was two weeks into the job when my line manager called me to work my third graveyard shift. I was running late on my way to Flint, driving down a dark, quiet road when I started hearing thuds from the back of the truck. First, they were light, gentle thuds. Then they gradually got louder, more frantic, more desperate.\n\nThen I heard the faint, muffled sound of someone crying. The sudden realization washed over me, sending shivers up my spine."," There was someone in the back of the truck.\n\nI felt my stomach twisting into knots. I pulled up to the breakdown lane and slowed the truck to a stop. Apart from the bright truck headlights, the road ahead was pitch black and empty.\n\nThe biting cold wind rushed against me as I stepped out of the truck, my heart hammering in my chest. I made my way to the back and pulled up the two latches on the rear door and tugged the door open.\n\nI opened the door and was immediately assaulted"," by the pungent smell of urine. It made me gag. As soon as the door started opening, I could hear a faint beeping noise. Probably a sensor.\n\nI raised my flashlight as I edged into the darkness. In the back of that truck, I found a huddle of people tied up on the floor, their wrists and ankles bound in ropes. Most of them seemed to be knocked out, but one of them, a woman, was awake. The image of her gaunt, pale face is forever etched into my memory. Her eyes widened when they met"," mine. \"Please.

That I was assigned a 3-week contract and was only informed that I would"," be delivering confidential, high-value goods. I had no knowledge of any human trafficking operation whatsoever.\n\nBut there was no official paperwork to confirm that I was ever employed by a company called RSA Commerce. As a matter of fact, there was no evidence that such a company ever existed. Not on the job board I applied through, and not anywhere else on the Internet. RSA Commerce was a dummy corporation.\n\nAll of my wages were paid by cash, so there were no wire transfers"," that the police could trace back to.\n\nThe number I used to contact my employer didn't exist anymore.\n\nThe truck I drove had a fake number plate and had been reported stolen. Its owner was 600 miles away in Iowa.\n\nThe policemen had raided the RSA Commerce warehouse in the early hours of the following morning. There was no trace of anyone there. Not a single soul.\n\nThere was no one at the drop-off points either.

There was, however, plenty of evidence that I was driving a stolen truck with a bunch of kidnapped people in the back.\n\nI was just a mule that they used to do their dirty work.

I wish I could flee from this ‘light’. I guess I should start from the beginning. People in my town keep saying there is a cloud over us, a coming"," storm. \n\nI work as a cable operator in my town so I get front row seats to all the juicy backwoods politics. Most nights I tune out and read my book but a few nights ago something caught my ear. One of the selectmen said “There’s a coming storm, and the townspeople won’t be ready.” He said these words exactly. Even my coworker who was seated next to me looked confused. The board brushed it off and the meeting went on as normal, a whole lot of nothing happened and when it came"," time to leave, I said goodnight to everyone and begun the short drive to my house. \n\nThe whole time I felt uneasy. There was a chill in the air walking to my car that was uncharacteristic of mid summer. Something felt horribly wrong. Slowly over the past few weeks board members have been stepping down at an alarming pace. At first I was worried about my job security. No board means no meeting to record and broadcast. \n\nWe got down to just 3 members, barely enough, before having"," a new election. At the following candidates night one of them kept saying those ominous phrases referencing “a cloud over our town, and the coming storm”. \n\nIt was around this meeting I started noticing weird details that weren’t quite adding up. The candidate in question, the one being ominous, was awfully sick just the night before at another meeting. Tonight he showed up in a suit and tie looking healthier than ever. Another person of interest in the town, the person in charge"," of the infrastructure and roads of the town, also was acting strange. Normally he has a loud bombastic attitude but he was quiet tonight, complacent. \n\nOn my way home I payed a little bit more attention. The suspicious candidate pulled out of the parking lot before I could and started headed into town. He happened to be going the same way I was going and about halfway to my house, this person pulled into our town’s church parking lot. It was 11 at night so this was already strange."," What made it worse was that throughout my 20 years living in this town, I have never seen anyone go in or out of that building. Nor have I ever seen the lights on inside. No one else that I know of has either. \n\nI’m a curious person and especially as of late I have tried to stave off my quest for knowledge because it has only been a bane to me but I just couldn’t help myself. I pulled into the old police station right across from the church and turned off the lights in my car"," and waited. About 5 minutes later a distinct red pickup truck pulled into the church lot, it was the road agent. They turned their vehicles off at the same time and got out. They walked up to the side entrance of the church and fiddled with something I couldn’t quite see before disappearing inside. \n\nNow I’ve watched enough horror movies to know I shouldn’t go in under any circumstances so I turned my car on and drove the rest of the way home. My mind was racing but somehow not"," with fear. I was ecstatic that something exciting was happening here for once so immediately when I got home I called my 2 friends who lived in town still until they woke up and explained the situation. Over the following nights we devised a plan to sneak into that church and see what was going on. It wasn’t a great plan, no big heist or anything, we were just going to take a crowbar to the side door assuming it was locked. \n\nA few nights later at around midnight we parked across"," the street and made our way to the church and walked up to the side door. Carl, my friend with the crowbar, walked up to the door and saw it was cracked open ever so slightly. Now I was second in our little line and I’m a rather paranoid person so I always carry at least a pocket knife but tonight, I brought my hunting knife that was affixed to my belt. I undid the latch that was locking it in its sheath as Carl opened the door. Our 3rd friend Joe was on lookout for most of the"," night. \n\nAs the door opened we saw a church interior. As our eyes adjusted we saw pews facing an altar kind of thing. We looked around and decided it was safe to turn on our flashlights. As the rays of light illuminated the wall above the altar there were eyes drawn in red all over the wall. Scrawled out around the eyes were the words “The Watcher Welcomes You” and “it’s watching” all in what appeared to be blood. Carl walked up to my altar while I looked around the rest of the"," church. \n\nThere was a few back rooms that had a small kitchen and almost a living room. The walls here were covered in eyes as well. They looked almost like Eyes of Horus, and some other words were thrown into the mix, “Khonsu”. I drew my knife to open a few cabinets and one of them, as I opened it something flew out at breakneck speed. I helplessly slashed at the air in front of me and when I calmed down I saw a falcon had landed on a chair in the other room. I slowly walked"," over to it and saw it was beckoning me to a few papers on a desk. \n\nScanning over it I saw some words about the ‘rebirth of humanity’. Right as I was about to pocket the papers I heard a commotion from the main room. Joe was now yelling for me to come and help, so I ran into the other room. What I saw there I can’t quite explain. I saw what I think was Joe, but his arm was split into hundreds of tendrils most of which were attached to Carl who looked dead. At least I hope he was."," \n\nJoe had some formless appearance almost. Something about his character was just, unclear. Almost like looking into a pond and seeing your reflection as a pebble is thrown in and it ripples around your face. That’s the best way I can describe it. I tried to run and pull Carl away but one of the tendrils caught my arm. It turned to the color of my skin and began to meld with it. I hacked off the tendril and the rest of what was attached to me wriggled and writhed wildly like a"," snakes body without it’s head until eventually it rotted away and turned to dust. \n\nI ran outside into the night and sat in the car, unsure if what to do next. I saw a small red gasoline tank next to the old police station. Acting out of mostly fear mixed with a bit of arrogance I grabbed the tank and began pouring it on the front steps of the church. I took a lighter from my pocket, lit it, and dropped it on the steps. \n\nImmediately it erupted into flames and the old wood of"," the church caught quickly after. Soon the whole building was consumed in fire and I stood back and watched it burn. I stood there across the street all night watching until the church was nothing but smoldering ash.

Imagine if it’s a dictator or a corrupt organization.”\n\n“So you’re saying Alex is working backwards?”\n\n“No, he’s working his way up.\"\n\n\"Why doesn't he focus on boosting the positive instead of working his way to stop the negative?\"\n\n\"He does, but it's the same. Like, remember the story he told us about helping that poor village where lots of kids died?\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"Don't you pay attention when"," he's teaching us?\"\n\n\"I try, but it's a lot of information. What did he say about the village?\"\n\n\"Medicine helped stop all the deaths, but they didn’t know to stop having so many kids and soon they had overpopulation and started starving. So it's important to think before helping. Get to know the people, their education, stuff like that.\"\n\n\"That’s a lot of work.\"\n\n\"Exactly. That's why Alex needs more of his kids to grow his network. And maybe if the ritual works on us too, we can"," live forever just like Alex and we’ll keep doing our best.”\n\nSebastian turned to me in surprise. “You want to do the ritual? Wouldn’t that mean you’d have to give birth to firstborn twins?”\n\nI shuddered. “No, and if it does, I don’t want to do it. But Alex said we can put my fertilized egg in another woman and she’ll give birth for me. And after I take a bit of their blood for the ritual, she can raise them.”\n\n“But if you didn’t literally give birth, can they be considered your"," firstborns? And does the ritual even work on women? Alex has only tried it on himself.”\n\nI shrugged. “I don’t know and he doesn’t either. We’ll have to experiment. But I hope it works.”\n\n“Do you really want to live forever with only Alex for company?”\n\n“I won’t be as paranoid as him, I’ll make friends. And I’ll have you too.” His expression made me hesitate. “Won’t I?”\n\n“I don’t know …” He sat up, studying my design in the sand before he rubbed the back of his neck. “I don’t think"," I’m cut out for this life.”\n\nI frowned. “What do you mean? I thought you couldn't wait to get the fancy life back.”\n\n“I thought that was what I wanted, but …” He seemed embarrassed as he chewed on the inside of his lip. “I guess what I really wanted was the carefree life I had as a kid, no responsibilities, my adoptive parents doing everything, spoiling me … but I'll never get that back. I'm an adult now, and I'm trying to figure out what I want. What I'm capable of.\n\n\"I like"," the idea of helping the world, but it’s too much for me. It’s too stressful. I also don’t want to live like Alex, isolated, secretive, and busy all the time. I just want a normal life. And … physical affection. Not even romantically, but like, just a hug. I know you hate to be touched, and there’s no way I’m hugging Alex, and Shirley can only give back so much.”\n\n“Oh …”\n\nSensing my guilt, he quickly said, “I’m not blaming you at all! And just you feeling comfortable enough to"," hold my hand means the world to me. Like a million hugs!”\n\nI gave him a grateful smile. “Thank you. Maybe soon we can try and see if I can manage a hug?”\n\n“I don’t want you to ‘manage’ anything for me. I want you to be comfortable and happy and to live the life you want. And the life you want isn’t the one I want, and that’s okay. You’re my sister and nothing can affect our bond, no matter what path we choose in our life.”\n\n“What path do you want?”\n\n“I don't want to mooch off"," of Alex, I want to get a degree and a job.” He looked down with an unfamiliar bashfulness. “And I’d like to get married and have kids. To work nine-to-five and spend the weekends having fun with family and friends. I don’t want the weight of extra responsibilities and stress. I know I won’t make as much money as Alex or my adoptive parents, but my family will have a comfortable life. And I don’t want them to know about Alex and his … situation.”\n\n“Would you want them to know about"," me?”\n\nHe turned to me, his emotions strong behind his eyes. “You're definitely going to be a part of their lives, whether you like it or not.”\n\nI chuckled. “Even if I do the ritual?”\n\n“Yes. You’ll just have to make yourself look older as they grow older, and eventually you might have to buy a gray wig or something. And then when they start having their own kids, you can pretend to be your own daughter, and do the aging thing all over again. And so on.” He paused, sadness lacing"," his warm smile. “That way, when I die, I’ll know you’ll always be there for my family in a way Alex can’t.”\n\nMy chin trembled and I wiped a tear. “Sebastian, that means a lot. But … but I don’t want you to die. Why can’t you and your wife and kids do the ritual too?”\n\n“And then what? Imagine, we’ll need twin firstborns. And if they decide they don’t want to die, they’ll have to get their own twin firstborns. And it’ll just go on and on. Where will we live? A band of immortals?"," All in Alex’s castle? That’s not the life I want. Not for me or for my family.”\n\nI nodded, looking down in disappointment. “I understand.”\n\n“But we’ll make the most of the time we have together.” Sebastian slid closer, holding his hand out. “We’ll do everything we can and then some.”\n\nI held his hand. He squeezed. I squeezed back.\n\n“Did you tell Alex?” I asked.\n\n“I did bring it up in one of our therapy sessions. He told me I was too young to make a decision like that, but he won’t"," stop me if I sought a relationship.”\n\n“Do you ever find it weird we're doing therapy with the person responsible for most of our problems?”\n\nSebastian laughed before shaking his head in amused disbelief. “Yes, I do, and I can’t believe it’s actually helping. It’s frustrating how good he is at everything, including this.”\n\n“Seriously! The other day I was talking about Derek and saying how horrible I felt for believing his lies, and Alex asked me if I’d like to confront Derek in"," person.”\n\nSebastian sat up, intrigued. “Ooh, what did you say?”\n\n“Well, it kind of shocked me a bit. I never considered actually doing that. So I sat there and imagined doing it … and it wasn’t satisfying.”\n\n“It wasn’t?”\n\n“No, because it wasn’t Derek’s fault. He’s just a pawn like the rest of us. He only did it because Alex paid him to. And if he didn’t agree, Alex would’ve paid another person to do it.”\n\n\"True.\"\n\nI let out a dry chuckle. “I told Alex that sometimes I saw him"," as our genius father who changed for the best, saved our lives, and was teaching us to save the world, and sometimes I saw him as an arrogant serial killer who'll never change, almost killed us, and manipulates people to get what he wants.”\n\nSebastian let out his own dry chuckle. “What did he say?”\n\n“He said both are the truth, different sides of the same coin, and I told him during my low points I saw the bad side and hated myself for working with him, and during my high points"," I saw the good side and was grateful things turned out the way they did.”\n\n“Wow, I haven’t been able to be that open with him yet. What did he say?”\n\n“He told me to spin a coin.”\n\nSebastian tilted his head in confusion. “What?”\n\n“He literally gave me a weird coin that was shiny on one side and black on the other, and he told me to spin it on the table. I did, and when it’s spinning, you see both sides so fast, they become blended. He said that’s how we should see everyone. Not"," two different sides. But a blend.”\n\n“So basically the whole idea of yin and yang.”\n\n“Of what?”\n\n“Like how there can be bad in good and good in bad and they could even complement each other.”\n\n“Hey, hello, sorry,” a woman said, walking around to face us with a camera dangling from her neck.\n\nSebastian and I looked up at her in surprise and she ducked her head. “Sorry! I didn’t mean to interrupt, but is that your dog?”\n\nShe pointed at the Great Dane splashing in the waves and Sebastian"," sat up, worried. “Oh, no, what did Shirley do now?”\n\n“No, nothing! She’s just beautiful, shining black against the azure waves, like an onyx shadow. I’m taking a photography elective in college and I just wanted your permission to take photos of her.”\n\nSebastian eased up, smiling. “This is probably the first time anyone said anything nice about Shirley.”\n\n“Hey!” I nudged the air playfully. “I say a lot of nice things about him!”\n\n“Yea, but you’re practically his mother, that doesn’t"," count.” \n\n“Wait, sorry, I’m a little confused,” the woman said with a shy chuckle. “Is Shirley male or female?”\n\nSebastian laughed. “Don’t worry about it, it confuses everyone. He’s male, it becomes obvious when you’re closer to him. Shirley’s short for Sherlock.”\n\n“Oh, cute name!”\n\n“I bet it’s not as cute as yours.” He stood up and held out his hand. “I’m Sebastian. And you are?”\n\nThe woman blushed as she shook his hand. “I’m Georgia.”\n\n“See, I was right. That’s a very cute name.”\n\nI"," stifled a laugh at his attempt at flirting, but it seemed to be working as Georgia tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. “You really think so? I always thought it was silly. My twin sister is Virginia and people used to make fun of us all the time.”\n\n“You’re a twin? Us too!” Sebastian gestured towards me. “This is my twin sister, Candace.”\n\n“Oh, what are the odds!” the woman said, thrilled as she smiled at me. “It’s so nice to meet you two. Do you live in the area or are you"," here on vacation?”\n\n“We’re on a business trip, actually,” I said.\n\n“Oh, really? You work? You look really young, I thought you were in college!”\n\nThis was something we didn’t have a lot of practice in yet, lying about our situation. It was easy faking our backstory for the people we do business with, but it was going to be difficult when it came to making friends. Or building relationships.\n\n“We’re twenty,” Sebastian said, “but after highschool our pop really needed our help,"," so we joined the family business instead. But I’d like to continue studying someday. Where do you go?”\n\nShe gave us the name of her college before adding, “I can show you around the campus sometime. Maybe this afternoon?”\n\nI could sense Sebastian’s disappointment. “I’d love that, but we’re actually flying back home in a few hours.”\n\n“But we’ll be back soon,” I added. “We do a lot of business here.”\n\nWhere do you live?” she asked.\n\n“On our own private island.” \n\nShe blinked in"," confusion, but then Sebastian and I laughed and she laughed along.\n\n“I wish,” Sebastian said. “We actually live in a boring, little town on the west coast.”\n\n“Oh, that’s nice.” Georgia turned to look at Shirley. “And I love that you bring your dog along on business trips.”\n\n“Yea, he hates being alone and he doesn’t warm up to strangers.”\n\n“I hope he warms up to me.” She turned back to Sebastian with a smile. “Do I have your permission to take photos of him?”\n\n“Only if I can tag"," along and watch a pro in action.”\n\nShe giggled. “Of course.”\n\n“And maybe I can take a few of you.”\n\n“Nuh uh, no one touches this camera but me. It’s delicate.”\n\n“I’m very good at handling delicate things.” He wiggled his fingers. “These hands are extremely gentle.”\n\n“Oh, are they?” She gave him a coy smile. “Maybe I’ll reconsider …”\n\nThey began walking away, bantering, and I watched them with an amused smile. I’d never seen Sebastian flirt before, and it was pretty funny. But"," Georgia seemed into it, and who knows? Maybe she could end up being the one to give him the hugs he longed for.\n\nAfter Shirley ran up to greet Sebastian, he sniffed Georgia’s shoes. She reached out a closed fist, and he smelled it before giving it a lick. It seemed he’d given her his seal of approval. Sebastian then tried to get Shirley to run in the waves again, but the dog seemed more interested in barking at a crab.\n\nGeorgia pointed to the ocean, possibly telling Sebastian"," to run there in the hopes Shirley would follow. Sebastian abided as he hustled towards the shore, and Georgia began taking photos before Shirley even caught up.\n\n…\n\n“Do you think Alex will get mad if he finds out we left TAI and our phones in the hotel?” I asked, getting out of the car. “What if he tries calling us, tracks us to our rooms, and only finds Shirley?”\n\n“We won’t be long,” Sebastian said, slamming his door and adjusting his tie. “I just don’t want him sticking his"," nose in our private business.”\n\nI looked around. “So, where are you meeting her?”\n\n“There,” he said, pointing to a cafe a few stores down.\n\n“There?” I turned to look him up and down. “Then why are you wearing all that?”\n\n“What do you mean?” He checked his reflection in the car window. “Is it too much?”\n\n“Yes, it’s a cafe, not a five-star restaurant.”\n\n“But it’s a date.”\n\n“Exactly. You don’t want to look like a stuffy manager. Lose the tie and jacket.”\n\nHe did as I said, tossing"," them in the car, and I nodded as I said, “Now just open the top two buttons. Perfect!”\n\n“Thanks!\" He took a deep breath. \"Okay, I’m going in. I’ll text you if things go south and I need an excuse to bail.”\n\n“Alright, I’ll just hang around here. Good luck!”\n\nAfter a few minutes, I began getting hot. And bored. You’d think a Saturday night would be teeming with activity, but there wasn’t much to do in this area. Only the cafe seemed alive with its sporadic couples and the soft music"," streaming from the speakers.\n\nTrying to be inconspicuous, I walked past the cafe, shooting a furtive glance inside. Sebastian and Georgia were at a corner table, laughing. A minute later, I passed by again. She was showing him something on her phone.\n\nWith both of them distracted, I took my chance and slipped inside. After ordering an iced mocha, I sat in the back, hiding behind one of the three other couples. A few shot me suspicious glances, but I ignored them as I sipped my"," drink and scrolled through my phone, enjoying the AC as I waited for my brother.\n\n“Are you kidding me?”\n\nI jumped in my seat at the incredulous voice and looked up, everyone turning towards the guy standing beside Sebastian and Georgia’s table. His red face was twisted in contempt as he stared Sebastian up and down.\n\n“Wayne?” Georgia said, going pale. “What do you want?”\n\n“Is that why you turned me down?” he spat, glaring at her. “So you can be one of this gangster's dozen side"," pieces?”\n\n“Hey,” Sebastian said, sitting up in offense. “Who the hell are you anyway?”\n\n“I should be asking you that question,” Wayne said, spewing a few curses. “You aren’t from around here. You think you can just mosey in and steal our homegrown girls? Your own race not good enough for ya?”\n\n“Wayne, please,” Georgia said. “You—”\n\nShe gasped as Wayne slapped her across the face, and my shock morphed to anxiety when Sebastian jumped up and pushed Wayne back. Wayne retaliated with"," a punch to Sebastian’s face, and my indignant fury took over as I ran towards them before my brother even hit the ground.\n\n“Leave them alone!” I yelled, shoving my palm against Wayne’s chest.\n\nHe yelped and crumpled to the ground, quivering against the volts I’d shot into him with the stun glove Alex made me. Screams erupted around us as chairs scraped and cups broke, but I ignored everyone as I turned to Sebastian in concern. He’d made it to his feet again, rubbing his cheek"," as he looked around the cafe with flustered eyes. Georgia was gone.\n\n“You get the hell out of my cafe,” a lady growled, emerging from the back with a shotgun. \"I don't condone violence in here!\"\n\nI tensed up. “He started it!” I said, pointing to Wayne groaning on the floor.\n\nShe cocked the shotgun. “I want all three of you off of my property!”\n\n\"Sh-she sh-shocked m-me!\" Wayne croaked.\n\n\"She pushed ya, we all saw it. And you deserved it. Get your sorry ass up, get the hell out,"," and never come back. You just graduated to a permanent ban.” \n\n“Y-you’re g-gonna r-regret th-this!”\n\nShe ignored him as she looked back at Sebastian and me. \"You two, out!\"\n\nI tugged at Sebastian’s sleeve. “Come on, let’s go.”\n\nWe hurried out of the cafe and hustled to our car, and I took a quick glance behind us before I asked my brother, \"Are you okay?\"\n\nHe shot me a glare. “What did you do to him?\"\n\nI took off my translucent glove. \"Alex made it for me when I told him I didn't"," like how two guys were looking at me in the lobby last time. It's like a stun gun. Maybe he can make one for you too.\"\n\n\"I don't need one.\" He snatched it from my hand, studying it with a clenched jaw before turning back to me. \"What the hell were you doing inside the cafe?”\n\n“I got bored and hot. And good thing I was there too.”\n\n“No it wasn’t! You made me look weak! Like I couldn’t defend myself or stand up for my girl!”\n\nI stared at him in disbelief. “Are you kidding me right"," now? The guy almost knocked your head off! You needed my help!”\n\n“No, I didn’t! I would’ve gotten up and punched him right back! Instead, now Georgia thinks I need my sister to babysit me!”\n\n“It's not babysitting! We’ve got each other’s backs!”\n\n“I didn’t need you to have my back! I could’ve handled it!” He opened the car door and slid in behind the wheel, yelling, “Next time I tell you to wait outside until I text you, you wait outside!”\n\n“You’re not my boss!” I said, trying"," to get in the passenger seat. “I can do what I want! Unlock the door!”\n\n“You ruined my date!”\n\n“*I* ruined your date? Really? Oh sorry, didn’t know you were planning on ending the night in the hospital!”\n\n“You’re such a—”\n\nI didn’t hear the rest of his insult as he revved the engine, and I jumped back in shock as he zoomed out of the parking spot, leaving me standing dumbfounded on the sidewalk.\n\nMy anger erupted and I had to fight the impulse to run after him screaming insults."," Sebastian was such a spoiled, self-centered, inconsiderate brat, and now he left me alone in a town I didn't know, with no phone, no TAI, and not even my stun glove.\n\nMy anger wavered at the thought of Wayne and I turned around in apprehension, half-expecting to see him charging at me. Instead, I just saw one of the couples who were in the cafe before, walking the other way as they shot me uneasy looks. This town was one of the worst we'd visited. I couldn't wait until we left.\n\nMy"," irritation returning, I faced the direction Sebastian took off in. Our hotel was a fifteen minute drive away. I've walked further before, I could make it in time for our flight tomorrow. I just had to be careful. And no hitchhiking. I wasn't making that mistake again.\n\nWith determined steps, I stomped down the sidewalk, my emotions roiling as I thought of Sebastian's reaction. I knew he had an ego and a temper, but abandoning his sister because he felt I'd embarrassed him by protecting"," him? What an idiot! Is Georgia's opinion worth more than my life? Where did she go, anyway? If she'd stuck around, she could've made him see he was brave for standing up for her. And if she didn't feel that way, then she didn't deserve him.\n\n\"Got some spare change, honey?\"\n\nI turned to see a disheveled lady peeking out of an ally's shadows, her grimy palm shaking as she held it out. Her smell, her look, her raspy voice, they tore through my present, taking me back to days that"," weren't that long ago. I was her once, addicted, begging, my future behind a dulling fog.\n\nShe was one of the many I wanted to help, but Alex said we had to work our way up. But she wasn't up. She was down. Rock bottom. Like I was before Alex told Derek to take me in. I doubted Alex would let me invite her to live with us, but I could still save her.\n\n“I want to help you get off the streets,” I said, walking over to her.\n\nShe smiled, her teeth reminding me of mine before Alex"," fixed them. “Yea?”\n\n“Yea, but you have to promise to get clean, stay clean, get a job, and keep the job.”\n\n“I’m clean as soap,” she said, scratching her arm as she eyed my purse. “How much you gon give me?”\n\n“You have to promise me first. I was like you once, and it’s possible to start a new life.”\n\nShe licked her chapped lips. “I promise.”\n\n“Alright, I’m going to ask—”\n\nBefore I could get the rest of the words out, sirens pierced the night, and the woman's eyes widened as she"," ducked back.\n\n“I didn’t sell her nothing!” she yelled, scurrying away into the ally's shadows. \n\nI whipped around as a police car approached, my legs twitching as my experiences prodded me to run. The car slowed down in front of me, and I gulped, trying to remain calm. Despite what it looked like, I did nothing wrong. I shouldn’t act guilty. I shouldn’t run.\n\n\"Get down on the ground!\" A cop yelled, jumping out with his gun aimed at me.\n\nMy heart jumped to my throat and I threw"," my hands in the air. \"I'm not armed!\"\n\n\"Down on the ground!\"\n\nTrembling, I got down on my knees and lay flat on the floor, making sure my open hands were in full view. \"P-please, don't shoot me, I didn't do anything. I was just talking to her. \"\n\nI cried out as he pounced on me, wrenching my purse away and twisting my arms behind my back. After cuffing my wrists, he yanked me up, and I cringed, holding back tears as he began roughly patting me down.\n\n\"P-please, I promise I was"," just talking to her,\" I said, my voice shaking. “I didn’t buy anything. I don’t do that anymore.”\n\n\"I hate how your kind is taking over our town,” he spat, shoving me in the back seat and slamming the door.\n\nMy pulse raced as I watched him slide behind the wheel and search my purse. “I swear I didn’t buy any drugs!\" I said. \"And I didn’t want to either! I just wanted to help her!”\n\n“Shut up.”\n\nI flinched at his tone, my fretful eyes darting around the car as my mind searched for"," a solution. How could I prove I was only talking to that poor lady? It was my word against this cop, and with my track record, who’d believe me? I didn’t want to go through this again. Not after I’d found my purpose working with Alex.\n\nAlex.\n\nI sat up, almost laughing at my distress. My triggered memories completely distracted me from one very important fact. Alex was in charge of everything. And I was his daughter. If this guy was in his network, he’d know the code word Alex"," gave Sebastian and me in case we ever needed help.\n\nLeaning closer to the divider separating us, I said the code word, and the cop glanced at me with irritated confusion. He had no idea what I said. But it didn’t matter. I just had to tell him the bold truth instead.\n\n\"At the station, I'd like to call my dad,\" I said, my voice steady. \"He's a very important man and he'll get all this sorted out.\"\n\nHe scoffed, tossing my purse on the passenger seat. “Important, huh?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nI"," tensed up as the car began to move. I'd been arrested before, I knew the process. This wasn’t the same. Did they have a different procedure in this town?\n\n\"Aren’t … aren't you going to check my ID on your computer and call it in?”\n\n“No.”\n\nI frowned. “But … are you arresting me? You didn’t tell me my Miranda rights. You didn’t buckle me up either …”\n\n“That’s right, I didn’t.”\n\nUnease seeped into my confusion. “Um, why?”\n\n“‘Cause that’s how my family does things down here. We pride"," ourselves on keeping our town pure of scum like you.”\n\n“What …what do you mean? Aren’t you taking me to the station?”\n\n“Nope. There’s no hope for your kind.”\n\n“But I didn’t do anything! I didn’t buy any drugs, I swear!”\n\nHis nasty chuckle made me shudder. “You’re as dense as your brother.”\n\nI froze. “M-my brother?”\n\n“He kept thinking he was being arrested for stealing the car he was driving.”\n\n“You … you arrested Sebastian?”\n\n“My brother Burt did.”\n\n“Wh-why? Why are you …” My"," stomach dropped as fearful realization erupted. “Is … is this about what happened in the cafe?”\n\n\"Did you think you could disrespect my brother like that and get away with it?\"\n\nI stared at him in shock. \"Wayne is your brother?\"\n\n\"Yup. And you're gonna regret ever laying a hand on him.\" He gave me another of his nasty chuckles. “Now just sit tight and stay quiet, or your brother’ll end up losing a few limbs.”\n\nI recoiled into the plastic seats, my heart hammering in my chest."," They had Sebastian. And now they had me. Wayne’s threat replayed in my mind. “You’re gonna regret this!” I thought it was aimed at the lady with the shotgun, but now it was obvious it was aimed at us. How corrupt was this cop that he was willing to risk his job so his brother could get his revenge?\n\n\"Are … are you a real cop?\" I asked with anxious hesitation.\n\n\"As real as they come.\"\n\n\"How can you do this? It's illegal!\"\n\n\"It's necessary to teach your kind their place.\"\n\nI tried"," to gather my courage as I said, \"I was serious about my dad. If you don't let us go, you'll regret it.\"\n\n\"And I was serious about your brother. Shut up and we might let you see him alive.\"\n\nA chill cascaded down my spine. I didn’t know what they were going to do to us, but the only way we were going to survive was by calling Alex. There didn't seem to be any hope of getting this guy to call. I had to find a different way.\n\nAfraid of making any sound that could get Sebastian harmed,"," I looked out the window, hoping to make desperate eye contact with someone. All I could see was the moon between thick clouds, and my heart dropped. We weren't in town anymore, or anywhere that seemed inhabited. No one was going to help me. I had to help myself.\n\nWith panicked determination, I felt around my cuffs. They couldn't be tightened, which meant they couldn't be shimmed. Hoping to find a way to pick them, I ran my fingers along the seat, searching for something long and"," thin. I found nothing.\n\nThe car took a sharp left, bouncing over unpaved roads, and I winced as I bumped my head on the window’s bars. Squinting through the darkness, I made out a few pale lights in the distance. As we got closer, I noticed it was a house, a vast field of corn stretching behind it. The car didn’t stop there though as it took another turn, and I shrank into my seat as the headlights illuminated a man walking out of a barn.\n\nWayne.\n\n[Previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkittishReflections/comments/v75ft7/eternity_trilogy/)\n\n\\-----\n\n[SR](https://www.reddit.com/r/skittishreflections)"],"title":"Eternity in Dog Years - Part 1/2"},{"content":["(First: https://redd.it/s648js\nPrevious: https://redd.it/v6fs3x\nSome child abuse in this one)\n\nWasting no time, Nick got out of the car the moment we parked. I lagged behind a little due to his heels giving him a little boost in speed. I expected the warehouse to be locked and for us to have to use Nick's lock picking skills, but that didn't turn out to be the case. The door was slightly open, showing us how the dark building looked inside. It was as if Piper wanted us to just"," walk right in. Silently, we slipped in through the small opening, and dove right into danger unaware of what would greet us.\n\nThe place appeared to be huge and cluttered with machines along with some shelving. More bags of the red powder were piled on tables near the door. I prayed that only three children suffered to make all this and not more that hadn’t been found yet. A clicking noise put my nerves on edge. I drew my gun reminding myself what lurked in the dark needed our"," help.  \n\nBetween the shelves came a sound of something falling to the floor. I looked over just in time to spot a very tall and thin women charging at us. Her long hair a mess, and face sunken. Firing two shots knocked her out. She cried out, collapsing to the ground. She wasn’t dead but that didn’t make me feel any better. Shooting a human target made my stomach tighten almost to the point where I couldn’t move. \n\nMore faces appeared from the darkness. Some male, same female."," Their bodies tall and hunched over. Long fingers twitching to dig into our flesh. At least it looked like they didn’t have a good handle of how to use magic yet. One tossed out a cracking ball of light, missing us by a mile to hit the pile of bags behind us. The powder pouring down to the floor. It drove them all into a frenzy trying to get at the red powder first no longer caring about the intruders. \n\nWe ducked out of the way from the swarm coming from every crevice. Some didn’t"," notice the drug due to the crowd and wanted to kill us. I fired, hitting most of my targets. My stomach flipping from stress and my eyes starting to sting with tears of fear. I wasn’t really meant for this type of thing. The ones I didn’t hit, skittered back off into the dark weary of the gun. A Witch got close; hands raised ready to attack. As she screeched towards us, Nick raised his gun to shoot. \n\nAn odd expression came over his face. His hand slightly shook and he didn’t"," pull the trigger. I grabbed him, dragging my partner aside as the Witch cut my back with her claws. In a frenzy she attacked and tore at my clothing. Blood flew from the cuts staining the ground as I shielded him. Through the pain I could tell the cuts weren’t life threatening. With some difficulty I got my gun pressed against her side to stun the feral Witch. She fell pinning me down for a minute. I struggled to get her off, concerned over more attacks and mostly for Nick. He'd"," never just froze like that before. \n\nThe other Witches stayed behind a little bit scared of us for now. I quickly got down to Nick's level. He'd fallen on his knees, and his hand covered his mouth. His eyes wide, seeing something I couldn’t. \n\n“I shot her...” His voice so low I almost didn’t hear him. \n\n“Nickie...” I started not sure of what I should be asking. \n\nTo my horror, a crack started to appear under his hand beside his mouth. I took his shoulders slightly trying to get"," him to talk about what upset him. Dropping his hand, I could see the new injury. Some hairline cracks started along the corner of his mouth.\n\n“I shot my partner.” He finally whispered.\n\nAiming a gun at the Witch triggered a memory for him. One I never wanted to come back. Aberash said everything about his partner was scrubbed from all records. Even if he heard her name he risked himself cracking. What happened back then was such a traumatizing event, his mind scrambled his memories"," for protection. This a really bad time for something like that to resurface. More Witches started to close in. They sensed weakness. My back bleeding from the cuts that stung like crazy and Nickie looked to be in no condition to fight. His hand loosely on the grip of the gun. He wanted to force himself to keep going. From the looks at the spider web cracks on his face, he would shatter if he pushed himself.  \n\n“I’ll carry this for you.”  \n\nReaching down, I took his gun. His fingers"," curled into a fist ashamed of himself. He'd done enough of the work. I could handle the rest so he could take a break. Standing up, I turned to face the small army of Witches that surrounded us. Each at different states of being turned. A few almost looked human. Some starting to get a grasp if how their magic worked. Their fingertips crackling with electric blue energy ready to be thrown. Off in the distance I noticed someone watching us from a catwalk across the back of the"," building. In the dim light, I couldn’t see their face, but knew who it was. The leader of the entire operation came out to look down on us. \n\nThat man killed at least three children. He ruined so many lives and turned these humans into something that could never be cured. Turns out, you didn’t need a special strategy when it came to fighting newly turned Witches. You just needed to be extremely pissed off. \n\nMy goal simply to reach Piper and to protect Nick. Nothing would get"," in my way of those two things. I fired the stunning bullets into the crowd, my entire body hot from rage and fear. Some of the electric attacks shot in our direction. It caught my arm I raised to block it. It hurt like hell, but it didn't take me out. These creatures not at all as strong as the ones we faced before. The numbers would be the main problem. There were far too many to shoot. Some broke free, getting within arm's reach. Letting out a yell of frustration, I punched"," the nearest one. My knuckles feeling like they would break. At least that took one Witch down. I did regret hurting them after everything they’d been through. That thought quickly got pushed to the back of my mind. \n\nOur of the corner of my eye, I saw one charging towards us far too late. At the last second, Nick swooped in to land a punch of his own. His hand smoking for some reason as the Witch dropped, face also smoking a little. He’d taken bullets from one of the magazines"," and somehow knew a way to activate them in his hand. The stunning magic hurt him, but mostly landed on the Witch. Grabbing another bullet, he tightened his fist to punch another Witch. We caught each other's eyes. Without any words needed, I knew he could cover me as I went after Piper. \n\nBreaking through the crowd, I ran faster and harder than I ever did in my life. Weaving between machines and junk in the warehouse, I charged forwards. Any Witch trying to get in the way got"," a swift bullet. The chest a easy target while running. I felt scared as I ran. I soon got low on bullets. Piper a half breed with powers I didn’t know about. I doubted I could really win against him. We just needed to hold out for backup to show up. \n\nI almost reached him. A massive Witch stood in my way between the leader who started to walked down the stairs to meet the intruders. The Witch twice my size. It must have taken a lot of the drug to become something like this. Long"," limbs thin and threatening. It looked so unnatural and reasonable shouldn’t be able to stand on those spindly legs. Beady eyes stared down at a smaller target. A large mouth grinned when I was forced to stop. My gun clicked empty. Tossing is aside, I checked to see how many more bullets was left in the gun I took from Nick. There might be enough for the Witch, but not for Piper. \n\n“A nice ssnnnnaacckkk....” The Witch spoke as if it was struggling to find words. \n\nA hand slowly"," reached out, ready to pluck my body off the ground. Gritting my teeth, I made eye contact with the thing. There wasn’t any damn time to waste on dealing with it. I felt pissed. So angry my hands could barely keep from shaking.\n\n“Back the fuck up.” I growled at the Witch in a voice so filled with venom I didn’t even know where it came from.\n\nThe Witch hesitated. Standing my ground, I didn’t take my eyes off it. This situation something it didn’t know how to deal with. Prey should"," be scared, trying to run away. If I started to stand up to it, I may either be crazy or have more power than it. By some miracle, the Witch decided that I could back up my threatening demeanor. It stood aside, slinking back off into the darkness leaving me to face the leader alone. \n\nOverall, he looked just like a normal person. His hair a common brown, and eyes creased with crow's feet. With his hands behind his back, he didn’t flinch when I fired some stunning bullets his way."," I saw them tear his clothing but he still didn’t move. The bullets having no effect on him. With a nasty smile he enjoyed my struggle. \n\n“Shoot all you want. My mother was practically immune to magic and the last of her kind. There is nothing an agent like yourself can do to stop me. And what a disgrace. All this effort to save humans. Where was this kind of action when a beast was tearing through our community eating all the children in sight?!” \n\nGood thing he was the type to"," do a villain monologue. Now I knew my gun would be useless and I could think of another plan. But his comments pissed me off to even think clearly. \n\n“Just because a shitty thing happened to you, it doesn’t give you a reason to hurt others! Anyone who killed children for their selfish reasons doesn’t deserve to plan the victim card!” I snapped back wanting to punch his face in. \n\n“The Corporation is the reason for all of this! Those children's blood is on your hands and there"," is nothing a hypocrite magic using agent can do about it! Do you have any idea how many agents are using Coven? In fact, you look familiar, have you brought from us? Have a sister by chance?” \n\nI became taken aback by his words. I froze, heart a block of ice. It gave him enough time to start cackling with his face starting to change.\n\nHis body transforming showing off his other side. Piper's hair becoming white, and ears getting longer. Spotting a steel pipe nearby, I grabbed"," in and in one swift movement, swung it directly into his face. The cracking sound jarred my bones as blood spurted from his mouth. His body fell hard to the ground, the transformation stopping.  \n\nThe dumbass was so confident all his bases were covered. He never considered there would be someone working for The Corporation who didn’t use magic at all. I turned ready to go back to help Nick when the doors of the warehouse burst open. Two more agents came in, moving faster than"," I could see.  \n\nIn a few minutes the other agents cleaned up the rest of the Witches. Form he looks of things; they went through a tough fight taking down the other dealers. Piper needed to be dragged out, jaw broken from the steel pipe to the face. I was questioned on how he got knocked out and the agents looked stunned when I said I didn’t use magic. Just a lucky shot.  \n\nI found Nick and let him sit off to the side. Soon the scene became swarming with the cleanup crew. People"," getting the Witches onto stretchers to be treated. The Corporation already set up a housing community for them. They would always be a creature now, but at least they would be taken care of. I helped carry stretchers of Witches out to be brought to a safe place. My body still hyped up from the fight. I refused to get treatment for my back until all the Witches were looked after first. Piper’s words rang through my head. Helping out was selfish on my part. I was just trying to"," see of any of the creature’s appeared familiar.  \n\nThe sun starting to rise by the time I sat down with Nick. I borrowed white shirt to replace my torn bloody one. Someone had placed a band aid over the cracks still on his face. \n\n“Are you alright?” I asked my partner as we watched the cleanup crew tidy up. \n\n“I should be asking you that.” He answered.  \n\nI was about to say I felt fine. The stress about my sister came crashing down. Unable to help it, I told him what Piper said"," before I knocked his teeth out. Nick appeared startled. He stood up at once ready to borrow a car to make it over to my sister’s apartment to check on her. I was so thankful to have a partner like him that would drop everything for a simple worry.  \n\nIt’s been years since I lived in that city. Nothing really changed making finding the apartment building easy. It still early in the morning and my sister could be mad for getting woken up. She needed to forgive me for checking in"," on her. Nick stood near as I rang the intercom at the front door. The lobby locked so she with need to let us in. Every second that passed was agony. My nerves fried as I rang the bell again and again with no answer. I pulled out my phone to call her with no result. Nick the only thing to keep me grounded. He suggested we should contact the landlord to see if he was able to do a welfare check.  \n\nIt was worth a shot. We got lucky and not only did the landlord pick up, he was a"," morning person. And very friendly. He listened to why I called and heard the stress in my voice as I asked if it was possible for him to have someone to knock on my sister’s door. He hesitated; his kind tone as stressed as my own. As I listened, I slumped against the cool tile wall as my world collapsed around me. \n\n“I’m sorry you need to hear this from me. You seem like a caring brother... Layla moved out a month ago. There was an incident with the police. Form what I heard;"," she was arrested for a minor drug case. Out within a few days and that was the last I’ve heard about her. She didn’t leave any contact numbers behind...” \n\nMy mouth almost too dry to speak. This couldn’t be happening. I talked to her a few days ago. She sounded fine. No mention of any of this. \n\n“The kids...” I started. \n\n“Oh, they’re fine. Staying with a boyfriend so I’ve heard. He was trying to get her doing better. They had fights over it that the neighbors complained about"," so that’s how I know all of this. For a while thing quieted down, then the arrest happened. I don’t have his number. I really wish I did, his first name is Brian if that helps.” \n\nThat name brought back so many memories I tried to keep locked up. He was the boyfriend she had when we moved in. Most likely the father of Jerry, my nephew. Brian the one with a drug problem. His small cramped apartment a mess, him not helping out in the slightest. I didn’t want to believe she’d gotten"," back together with him after all this time. A flood of noise came to my head. So much that I needed to press a hand over one ear trying to block it out. \n\n“If it’s the same guy, I know his number. Thank you for telling me all this. Did she... leave anything behind?” I asked trying to speak over the sounds rattling around in my head. \n\n“She didn’t have much to start with. All of the kid's things went with them. She took her clothing and such. Her couch and mattress she left behind"," is long gone, sorry. They were too worn out to save. She owed some rent, but I’ll take that as a lost. From what the neighbors heard; her money was coming from a family member. I think that was you, and I don’t want you to keep paying for her.” \n\nMy chest hurt. So much I thought it might break open. I’d been sending her money since I moved out. I wanted her to take care of herself and the kids. How did it all end up like this? I was completely blind to everything going on. If"," I just once came by to see her in these years, would anything have changed? I got the landlords name and promised him I would payback what she owed. Right now, I needed to find her. \n\nNick listened, worry clear on his face. I asked him if there was a way to abuse his Corporation connections to find her address. The Brain I knew might not be the same person. If he was, he might not know where she was either. He quickly got on the phone to call in any favors he may have to try and"," find her. With shaking hands and a roaring of noise in my head, I dialed a number I still remembered from so many years ago. The call answered within a few rings as if he was waiting. I told him who it was, and it took him a little bit to clue in. \n\n“Skyler! God, you sound so different! Jesus, I’ve been trying to find your number. I’m so glad I kept this one. You changed your last name and everything. I didn’t have the money to hire someone to find you, and your sister refused"," to give me your number. I swear, she had a hidden phone just for your calls...” He trailed off, unsure of what else to say. There was a hard question to ask hovering in the air so he let it out. “How much have you found out? You would never call me otherwise.” \n\nA mixture of a baby crying and the sounds of Layla and him fighting came into my head. I couldn’t speak for a while. It all hurt too damn much to hear his voice again after getting as far away from him as I could. When"," I didn't answer, he kept speaking. \n\n“Listen, I understand if you don’t believe me, or hate me still after everything. I was a piece of shit to you and your sister and God, the kids. I have no reason for why I was like that. I’ll say I’m sorry a million times if it would make it better but it won’t. All of this hit me after I nearly died from an overdose. I was in the hospital and it sunk in I had a kid somewhere. That got me on my feet. I stopped using and found your sister again."," We’ve been on and off for two years after I got my shit together.” \n\nA sound came from the other end. He started talking with Jessie, my niece. She’d just woken up wondering who was on the phone. I pressed the phone against my ear so hard it hurt just to hear her voice. We both knew we needed to get everything out in the open and not tell her who called just yet. Brian went into a different room so we could keep talking. \n\n“Are the kids alright?” I asked finally finding my voice."," \n\n“Yeah. As much as they can be. They miss you. And their mom. But I needed to take them out of that place. I... I hate to say it but I don’t think she should be near them for a while. Layla needs to see someone. I don’t know what she got a hold of. It was only a little, but it changed her so much. She saw how much she was scaring the kids and went off of it for about a month. Then she just snapped and... Jesus, she bit Jessie. Nearly took a chunk out of her arm. I can totally"," understand if you think I'm lying. She’s your sister and I was such a piece of shit towards you.” \n\nMy body curled up tight. The images of those Witches flashed through my mind and I almost crushed the phone in my hand. My breathing started to get heavy and it took everything to not pass out. \n\n“I’ll find her. I’ll take care of her.” I said in a trembling voice. \n\n“Skyler, I’m sorry. I wanted to help her out this time. You’ve been taking care of her for years. Back when you lived"," with us, you paid our bills and went to school and took care of the kids. I’ve always been sorry for that. All the adults in your life let you down and I was one of them.” \n\nShaking my head, I forced back the tears remembering that point of my life. We both worked like hell, didn’t we? Layla always out of the house, almost never home. Wasn’t she? There was simply no way she wasn’t working and dumping everything on her younger brother. This needed to be a lie. All of it. For some"," reason Brian was being overly cruel. What he said next made everything click. It all made sense to the point I couldn’t deny it.  \n\n“I think she only took you in to use you.” \n\nAfter all these years, I finally saw what kind of person my sister was. I could only see her as the person I grew up with. A little bit spoiled but caring. The only person on my side. Then again, it was simple to compliment my short hair if that meant I gave her my allowance. Or covered for her when she"," snuck out to see her boyfriend. It was possible my sister was using me for so long, I just assumed it to be love. \n\nGetting down to my level, Nick whispered that he had her address. Everything I learned didn’t change the fact she was still my sister. If she took some Coven, she needed treatment. Those sounds still echoing through my head. I almost couldn’t bring myself to stand back up. \n\n“I think she’s in trouble. I just got her address. I’m going to go see her. Thank you for"," taking care of the kids. I’ll come and see them when I can.” \n\nI was about to hang up when Brain spoke again. \n\n“Hey, Skyler I'm proud of you.” \n\nThat got an ugly hiccup of a cry out from my chest. We couldn't dwell on it. I thanked him again to follow Nick to the car and towards my sister. Wherever she ended up, I was going to find her. \n\nThe car wasn’t even parked when I bolted out from it. The place looked like a very run-down house with an over grown lawn. The last place I"," wanted Layla to be in. Nick was right behind as I pounded on the front door. Paint flaking down from the force. Movement from behind the door made my heart leap into my throat. It opened slowly to show the musty, ruined inside. The person standing in front of my eyes looked like someone I almost didn’t recognize. Her red hair cut short and limp. Sunken eyes and a lot of weight lost. She’d always been curvy unable to drop the pounds no matter what kind of diet she’d gone on in"," the past. Her limbs now too similar to a Witches for comfort. \n\n“Unless you have something really good, I don’t do two at once.” She said in a weak voice.  \n\nWith shrug, Layla turned to walk back inside as I froze to the spot. She collapsed back onto a dirty torn couch, asleep in seconds. I walked inside to see just how bad the place looked. The carpet crusted over from all the food and drink litter around. The walls covered with years of cigarette smoke with water stains mixed"," in. The house should be torn down. No human should live here. And yet, my sister was asleep on the couch. \n\nIn that small front room, so much sound came crashing down into my head at once. A voice screaming over top of it all. That I’d done all of this. I abandoned her. She was going to turn into a Witch that hurt others. Not just others, but her own children. Once The Corporation knew about it, she would end up being hunted and killed. It was all my fault. I was to blame. I’d"," killed my sister. \n\nNick grabbed a hold of my arms to pulled my trembling body into a tight hug. I realized that the voice wasn’t in my head. I said all of that out loud without knowing. The only thing keeping me from snapping completely was my partner trying to squeeze the stress out of my body. I’ve never felt so small before. \n\n“There is no way you could have known. She made her own choices and never reached out for help.” He started and I shook my head against his chest. \n\n“I’m"," her brother. It's my job to-” \n\n“It’s your job to love her. You’ve done that. You did everything you could.” \n\nThat the bitter truth of it all. I got so busy trying to work and support us, I missed everything about her. I never once came in person to check up on her and just sent money her way assuming that would be enough. Still convinced I failed, I pulled away to go over to my sister. She needed to be woken up and taken somewhere she could be taken care of. Nick stood back"," to watch us. I shook her shoulder, saying her name. She swatted my hand away trying to sleep. \n\n“Layla, it’s your brother. You need to go somewhere with me.” I said softly. \n\n“I don’t have a brother.” She muttered still with her face nearly pressed into the dirty couch. \n\n“It’s Audrey.” \n\nThe name tasted bitter. Something I sworn I would never call myself again. As much as I hated it, I loved her a little bit more. She looked up; eyes glazed over confused. She still didn't know"," who I was, but knew the name. \n\n“Audrey is in the other room.” She mumbled and put her head back down. \n\nI didn’t understand why she would say that. Was there another person in the house? Someone she might confuse for a sister? Suddenly, Nick moved. He swiftly went across the room on a mission to the hallway. \n\n“Skyler, call an ambulance and do not follow me.” He said sternly as he disappeared in the dark doorway. \n\nLayla looked just to be tired. She didn't need an ambulance as"," far as I could tell. Whatever got my partner going would be a bad sight. I felt it down to my bone. I should have listened to him. My body moving on its own as I followed behind, not doing anything he ordered. I found him in a side room, nothing inside it besides trash, a mattress on the floor and a small plastic table. He was on his knees picking something up from the stained mattress. His suit jacket off to wrap up whatever he found. When he stood up and I saw what he held,"," my knees gave out. \n\nHe'd wrapped up a newborn in his jacket. Thin red hair made it clear who she belonged to. The child far too small and far too still. I couldn’t move. I couldn’t even think. Any fear I felt facing a supernatural creature was nothing compared the feeling that burst into my chest. \n\nHe acted quickly, knocking off the beer bottles from the table to clean it off. With on hand, he drew a circle and wrote some odd words along it. Within seconds, he also had drawn"," more circles in a spell so complex I’ve never seen one like it before. Carefully he placed the bundle on top of the writing. His next action causing me to stifle a scream. Without hint of pain, Nick snapped off his pinky finger. The digit turning into a glittering rough ruby after he removed it. The small stone placed on the bundle of fabric and the circles glowed. When they faded, the stone did as well.  \n\nThe half second that passed felt like the longest in my life. The small"," face poking out from his jacket scrunched up and she gave out a very loud cry. Soon she wailed as Nick picked her back up. Oddly being very good at carrying and smoothing a crying baby. \n\nThe next few hours became a haze. He called an ambulance for my sick niece. He could only heal her so much and she needed to be looked over by some doctors. Her weight nothing healthy for a baby her age. \n\nAt first, the police arrived for my sister. Agents replaced them to take her way. Forms"," handed over for me to sign. They explained that the withdrawals would last her entire life. Unless she was supervised, she risked harming any child she may come across. I would be able to see her and call her whenever I liked. But Layla’s life now set to be taken care of her for her. Housing and food provided. Some freedoms but not much. The forms just to say I understood and not asking my permission. No matter what I said, The Corporation would take her. \n\nI didn’t want to believe"," that Layla had a daughter without anyone knowing about it. I spoke to Brain who was shocked. He said it would explain a lot of she’d been pregnant recently. She’d always looked fairly normal while she was pregnant with the other two. She didn’t really gain any weight and we didn’t know about my nephew until he was born. It possible Brian wouldn’t have noticed a third child if she kept it from him. \n\nAudrey looked to be doing well but needed to stay in the hospital until she gained"," the weight back. After she was taken care of, I did something I never wanted to. I called my parents to sort of fill them in on everything. I thought they might want to know about another grandchild. They didn’t. At least they heard me through. The only words my father replied with was, ‘it sounds as if you have this all under control’. \n\nHe hung up after that. Both of them washing their hands of their children and grandchildren. \n\nI stayed in the city not returning home yet."," Nick hung around making sure I ate something as I spent a few days just silently mulling over everything that happened in a hotel room. When my niece recovered, she would need to go somewhere. Brian didn’t know who her father might be. He hadn’t been on good terms with my sister for a long time. He only been by for the kids. He offered to take her, but I could sense the stress in his voice. He already trying to raise two kids along with dealing with his own recovery. A newborn"," would break him even though he would never admit it.  Unaware of how long passed, I ran the options through my head a thousand times. My thoughts becoming to cluttered and so loud I needed to get out of the building.  \n\nI walked aimlessly. Everything just so loud it was impossible to deal with. Finding an empty park, I sat on a swung for who knows how long. The clutter in my head nearly getting to a breaking point. The sun set as I sat, one hand pressed over my ear trying to drown"," out the sounds. A closed umbrella came into my sight and a voice cut through all the noise. It the only thing I could hear clearly. \n\n“It might rain.” \n\nNick stood holding out the umbrella for me to take. I almost cried seeing him. His hand scarred over from missing a finger. He sacrificed it to save my niece and would never get that finger back. Guilt mixed into all the other emotions as I took the small umbrella in my hand, twisting it in stress. I needed to tell him the worst"," news and didn’t know how to start. He walked over to the swing next to mine. To my surprise, he put on foot awkwardly on it, then another so he was standing on the swing.  \n\n“I’ve never done this before.” He commented looking at the park from his new height.  \n\n“You’re still wearing the heels.” I pointed out. \n\nHe still wore the chunky heeled shoes. Nothing too feminine but enough for someone to notice. \n\n“I like being tall.” \n\nA hint of a laugh bubbled up. Nickie the only person"," who could cheer me up when I felt this bad. The noise dying down after he arrived. My chest still feeling like a black hole from what I needed to tell him. \n\n“I can’t... Keep doing cases with you. Audrey doesn’t have anyone. My parents won't take her in. My sister won’t ever be able to be trusted around her and Brian can’t take care of another kid. We can still see each other but...” It felt too hard to finish. \n\nMy eyes already flooded with tears I rubbed away. To start with,"," I wanted to do cases for the money. Who cared about my life? As long as I could get my only family taken care of. Now, with my sister out of the picture, I wanted to use what I’ve saved so far for a house for Brian and the kids. He just didn’t know it yet. Along with some collage funds. I wanted those two, now three to never have to worry about money.  With Audrey needing someone to raise her, I simply couldn’t do dangerous jobs every other week. I needed to stay around for her."," I expected Nick to be upset, instead it kept staring forwards as if trying to processes what I said. \n\n“There is another option.” He offered. \n\nMy face flushed and the anger came no matter how much I wanted to keep it down. \n\n“She’s my family! I can’t abandon her! It’s because I didn’t check up on my sister this all happened! I just keep playing around-” I stopped myself, regretting the words I already said and what I nearly just did. \n\nWe weren’t playing around doing cases. What"," we’d done so far helped a great deal of people. Luna alive and happy because I worked that case. I just felt so useless in my mind, my actions didn’t matter. That no matter what, these cases would have been finished and I did nothing to help. Nick was right about the option to give up my niece. It cut down deep to even think about. Either way, I would be abandoning my family. \n\n“Recently there has been an increase of supernatural; creatures of different species getting together.”"," Nick started on an entire new conversation that confused the hell out of me. Ignoring my puzzled look, he went on. “The issue is most species cannot produce and off spring together. And the birth rates among creatures as normally low. On top of that, most species cannot raise another from their conditions being so different from their own. A new trend is creatures adopting human children because they are fairly simply to take care of.” \n\n“You... Want me to let a creature adopt"," my niece?” I said slowly stunned. \n\n“I would like you to do what you feel is best. I am only bringing this up because word of your situation has leaked. I’ve been hounded but a great deal of couples to just mention the option. On top of being a flood of written requests in the office even though there has been no word of what you’ve decided to do. It is only a matter of time before one of those creatures speak to you directly and I would have liked the idea to come from your partner"," and not from a couple pressuring you.” \n\nI would have had no idea there was such a demand for children. It only been a few days and already a few families lined up praying to even be considered. Chewing on my lip I thought over what Nick said. I’ve been around enough supernatural creatures to know about the good ones. Not all of them ate humans. Some were more caring than any human I’d met. If I went down that route, my niece would be cared for. Maybe even more than what I could"," give her. The mixture of stress, no sleep and lack of anything in my stomach besides some vending machine snacks made it turn. My face must have shown it. Nick reached into his pocket to pull out a wrapped candy. He handed it down and I didn’t really feel like eating it. \n\n“I’ve noticed you get an upset stomach often. I made these to help with that.” He explained. \n\nI unwrapped it to see a round golden hard candy. It tasted like honey and did help with my stomach. Yet again I"," wanted to cry.  Not only did he notice something so minor, he put the time into fixing it. I didn’t know what to do. Letting someone take Audrey would be the better idea. I couldn’t provide the care two parents could. I loved her and would do my damn best to make her happy, but lacked any confidence myself. I was just getting to like myself. What kind of life would she have with a parent like that? At the same time, giving her up felt selfish on my part. It was as if I didn’t"," want to deal with her cramping my lifestyle and shipped her off. Nick tried to step down from the swing. When one foot moved, the entire swing did. He found it difficult to stay balanced. This man jumped from a cliff before and now he couldn’t bring his foot down half a step to the ground.  \n\nSighing, I stood up to help him down. Every time I needed to support his weight, I forgot how heavy Nick was. His foot slipped and we crashed down to the ground. I nearly choked on the hard"," candy making him decided the next batch would be soft ones. \n\nWe both stayed on the ground where we fell. Looking up at the dark sky as a misty drizzle started to come down. \n\n“None of this is your fault.” He said over the gentle sounds of the rain. \n\n“I know. But I won’t ever be able to forgive myself. This guilt is going to be here no matter what I do. How... Do you handle it?” Looking over, I stared at him trying to read his expression. \n\nHe'd killed his partner. Nickie carried"," that guilt every day. I didn’t know what I could do to help him with that besides keep telling him it wasn’t his fault. Now I understood, that didn’t really amount to much. The band aid still on the side of his mouth showing the cracks hadn’t fully healed yet. \n\n“I keep living.” \n\nThe background noise in my head faded to be replaced by the sound of the rain. We may be stuck with what happened in the past. If we kept moving on then maybe someday things might hurt less. The wounds"," possibly never fully healing over, but we never would have a chance to forgive ourselves if we just stopped. Nickie really was stronger than anyone gave him credit for. \n\nWith the rain getting heavy, Nick forced us to go back to the hotel. A decent meal, a hot shower and a long nap later, my head got clear enough to finally make the hardest choice of my life. \n\nAudrey recovered, ready to be taken home. Her cheeks pudgy as they should be. She very vocal like how my sister acted"," growing up. I sat holding her swaddled in my arms talking to her in an empty hospital hallway. I wanted to tell her so much in such a short amount of time. She wiggled and answered to my questions in words only she understood. I loved her more than I had any right. But I didn’t regret my choice. \n\nA pair arrived, followed by Ancaer who needed to look over the process for some reason. One tall and thin with pale green hair. Their face was flat, with large sparkling eyes. The one"," next to them was a middle-aged man. His black hair tied back and a horn coming from his head. Hooves clicked against the titles as they stopped to waited, appearing as nervous as I felt. I wasn’t ready, but I stood up to go over to them. \n\nThey didn’t reach out, not believing this was really happening. \n\n“Are you sure?” The taller one asked in a shaking voice. \n\n“I'm positive.” I said and held out Audrey for them. \n\nIt was nearly impossible to pick out a couple from the hundreds"," who submitted the forms. I knew no matter who I picked; my niece would have a good life. Still, I felt bad for everyone I needed to pass on. At some point I would tell Brian about supernatural creatures so him and the kids could see Audrey and her adopted family. He regretted not being able to take her just as much as I did. We both knew this was the right choice though.  \n\nThe moment the bundle was in Fleur’s arms, the taller one, they broke down into tears. They muttered a word"," I didn’t know the meaning of over and over again while brushing Audrey’s hair with a long finger. Their partner translated the word. It meant treasure. This was absolutely the best choice. My only worry was how spoiled my niece might be the next time I saw her. \n\nWe stayed and spoke with each other for a while until they needed to go. The pair left with a lot of tears and hugs ready to finally live as a family. Ancear stayed behind holding some more forms I needed to sign. I swear,"," I’ve already signed a thousand of them. As I filled them out, I wondered why he let us to do this case. \n\nIt was possible he knew the outcome. At least part of it. He could have easily found my sister’s drug arrest if he looked up her name. I did put her down as my emergency contact, so I assumed someone looked her up. And then a case comes by about a drug ring in the same city she lived in? He approved us doing this case aware there might be a chance my sister was involved in"," some way. I handed over the forms, and paused to look at him. His regular scowl staring back down. \n\n“Did you know about my sister?” I asked him risking it. \n\nHe snatched the sheets away giving my finger a papercut.  \n\n“I do not care enough about a human enough-” \n\n“Thank you.” I cut in knowing he wouldn’t admit it either way. \n\nI felt glad we took this case. I could finally be there for my sister instead of some other agent finding her far too late. Ancaer didn’t expect those"," words. His face flushing as deep red as his hair. \n\n“Never!” He growled, mind so scrambled he wasn’t able to say anything else. \n\nHair flared up, he stomped away angrily muttering to himself about something I couldn’t hear. This might be the first time anyone thanked him and meant it. His flustered reaction something no one would believe if I told them. \n\nNick waited outside the hospital so he could get me home. After this case I really needed a break. Far too much to think about"," and second guess myself over. I called my sister to explain to her what was decided. She honestly didn’t care about her newborn, or much about anything. The person I thought I knew long gone. The sister I’d loved for so long died to be replaced by a person I knew nothing about. It was as if I’d lost my entire family finding out the truth. \n\nWhen Nick gave me an awkward hug, I knew I didn’t lose my family. I still had a sibling left. And my nieces and nephew. I swore then, I would"," never let anything happen to them. I was not going to lose another person I loved more than myself."],"title":"I work as a P.I and a Government Agent approached me to help with a case. (Part 37)"},{"content":["Hey everyone, not sure how to start this post so I'll just introduce myself and start from the beginning. My name is Jared, I'm 17 years old now, but the events that I'm about to tell you happened about 5 years ago. \n\nIt starts with me and my grandfather William. We were going fishing just like we had many times before, in our little boat, in the middle of a lake. I loved those moments with my grandfather, it was relaxing and he would tell me stories all day long. \n\nOne day it"," all changed however, a day I wish never happened. Still after 5 years, I'm not forgetting any details, it's still burned deep into my mind. It started out normal enough, we gathered our fishing gear, got it in the back of our truck, and hopped in. We headed out for the lake and the drive went by smoothly. \n\nAfter we got there, we transfered all of our gear from the truck into the boat and got in ourselves, letting the water carry the boat as we made our way a bit deeper. It was"," beautiful out in the water, sourrounded by nature, our boat gently rocking left and right. It was a great lifestyle and we both loved it. \n\nAs we were casting our fishing rods, my grandpa telling me one of his many stories, I noticed a glinting a bit in front of our boat. I pointed it out to my grandfather who decided to try to fish it out, maybe it was a necklace or something, and we thought it would be cool if we found something like that in the water. \n\nAs my grandfather cast"," his line and started to roll it back I could see he didn't catch the shining object, he did catch something though, I could see it even under the water. As he pulled the object out we could both see it was a bone. Hmm weird we thought but nothinf out of the ordinary, it was small enough to be a fish bone or something so he just cast the line again. \n\nThis time however the line seemed to struggle with the weight but we could see the shining object coming up. As he was bringing"," it out I could see the object was attached to something bigger, but in the water I thought it could just be some some random trash laying around. \n\nAs he got it out of the water however, it all changed. What we saw in front of us was without a doubt, a human skull, and there was a pendant attached around one of the eye sockets. My grandfather quickly tossed the fishing rod from his hands and he wanted to go home immediately, we didn't bring cellphones so we had to get back home"," to call the police. \n\nWe made it back and in a rush we jumped into the truck as he sped off. It was slowly starting to get dark and as we made our way home, forest sourrounding us. \n\nI thought I could see a shadowy figure running along our side in the forest on multiple occasions. I didn't bring it up to my grandpa, however, because it looked like it was humanoid but running on 4 legs, and I was sure humans can't run that fast, so I just thought it was my imagination because I"," was scared. \n\nWhen we got home, my grandpa called the police and told them where the lake was and that there was a fishing pole there too. Some officers came to our house too to get a report, and we explained how we came across it. \n\nThey thanked us for our time and were on their way as me and my grandfather watched behind. That night I had trouble sleeping, waking up multiple times to see a shadowy figure in the corner of my room, just for it to be gone after I blinked again."," \n\nI woke up the next morning, feeling tired like I had ran a marathon instead of sleeping. I got down and my mom had already cooked me some waffles for breakfast, which made the morning a bit more bearable, I loved waffles. \n\nI finished up eating and headed outside to play with my friends, but I could never shake the feeling of being watched. When I brought it up to my friends they would say that they felt normal and that I'm just paranoid. I believed them, I hadn't seen anything"," after all, and I was ruining fun for myself and them because of my paranoia. \n\nIt still didn't help, in fact, every day that went by the feeling became stronger and more frequent. It had gotten to the point where I didn't want to leave my house at all, because I was feeling unsafe. \n\nWhen my grandfather saw me acting strange he asked me what was wrong. \n\n\"I don't know grandpa, I saw something moving parallel to our car when we were coming back from that lake.\" I said, expecting"," him to comfort me and say how everything is going to be fine. \n\nWhat I saw instead was a look of pure terror and panic on my grandfather's face as he got up and frantically paced around the room. \n\n\"They followed us, I should've known they followed us, they never found the damned skull, it was a trap all along!\" He said as I saw couple of tears forming in his eyes. \n\n\"Why the hell are you telling me this now huh? Why didn't you tell me earlier?!\" He yelled as I started to cry,"," thinking I had done something terrible. \n\n\"I'm sorry grandpa, I thought it was my mind playing tricks on me because I was scared! I didn't... I couldn't..\" I trailed off as tears coated my cheeks and dripped down from my face. \n\nMy grandpa didn't even look at me as he headed for the stairs. \n\n\"We're doomed.\" I could hear him mumble as he made his way up. \n\nI couldn't sleep at all that night, I felt guilty. I didn't know why was my grandfather so upset, sure I could sometimes see"," a figure in the shadows or feel someone watching me, but it never affected me otherwise. \n\nWhen it was about 4am, and I could finally feel my eyes getting heavy. I could hear some sort of chanting sound mixed with buzzing. Right after that I heard a loud crash in the hallway. I didn't know what it was but I was too scared to look, I stayed in my bed untill I heard my mom scream loudly. \n\nI jumped out of bed, not caring about the fear anymore, thinking something bad has happened"," to my mother. As I rush out to the hallway, I see my mother crying over my grandpa who was laying on the floor. When I got closer I saw the reason the was crying, my grandpa looked like he had drowned, blue color enveloping his skin, his clothes wet. \n\nI couldn't hold my vomit in any longer, I puked all over the floor, feeling nauseous and lightheaded as I passed out. I woke up in my room, my mother sitting next to me on a chair. She hugged me after I woke up and cried on my shoulder."," I asked her if grandpa was dead and she just nodded her head. \n\n\"His lungs were full of water, no one knows how it happened or how was he able to get to the hallway with his lungs full of water. It was all a mystery. \n\nMy mother did however, report that she heard whispered chants along with buzzing. After I told her I heard the same thing, she was shocked, thinking it was all in her head from the lack of sleep she'd been getting recently. \n\nWe both went to bed that night, my eyes"," growing heavy as soon as I laid down on the bed. I dozed off almost immediately from exhaustion, but I was awoken by the sound of whispered chanting and buzzing coming from the hallway. \n\nThinking whatever that was had killed my grandfather I stayed in my room, silent as the night outside of my house. That was until about 20 minutes later. I once again heard my mother scream and then gurgle like she was drowning. \n\nI jumped out of bed again but as soon as I reached for the door"," the sound stopped. As I opened it I could see my mother in the same state my grandfather was the night before, blue skin, wet clothes. I started crying uncontrollably for hours until I finally found myself going to the phone and dialing 911. \n\nAmbulance came, police officers came, I don't remember any of it, the funeral, those couple of days went by in a blur. I found myself in a foster home right up until last month. They let me come back to my property because I was turning"," 18 soon. \n\nAs I'm writing this there is a sound in front of my door, it sounds like whispered chanting and buzzing. I think they are waiting until 12am, when I turn 18. \n\nThis is probably my last day here, and I wanted to post this as a warning to everyone. \n\nIf there is a shiny object in the water while you're fishing, turn around and go home, it's not worth it."],"title":"I Went Fishing With My Grandfather, Something Followed Us Home"},{"content":["This all started when my wife, Meg, and I had discussed cutting cut down on some of our streaming subscriptions (among other expenses).\n\nI had been away for a conference for a few days and when I walked in, she was staring at the TV, her brown eyes wide, taking in every second of it. She was watching one of those shows that follows people as they choose a house. We'd watch these kinds of shows all the time, we’d try and guess which house they’d pick, so I looked over as I put away"," my keys and jacket.\n\nSomething was wrong that made me do a double-take. The realtor looked like someone had run her over with a lawnmower. She was bleeding from fresh looking gashes on her face, neck, and chest and a puddle had formed on the pristine white carpet of the home she was showing. She and the couple left footprints in it as they walked, I could even hear the faint wet squelching noise of them stepping on the areas where it had saturated the carpet. They all acted as"," if this totally normal and the realtor had a huge smile on her face. Maybe this was a horror movie based on the TV show? I looked at Meg out of the corner of my eye, if she thought this was abnormal her face certainly didn’t reflect that. She’s very squeamish and hates anything violent or gory, so I was surprised.\n\nI decided to unpack a bit – maybe I was imaging it due to the jetlag mixed with exhaustion. When I came back in the living room, though, the realtor was writing some"," sort of weird symbols on the wall using her own blood, all the while having a seamless conversation about how many full bathrooms the house had.\n\n“...the fuck?” I muttered\n\n“Right?”, Meg gave a little laugh, not taking her eyes off the TV, “I don’t know why some realtors show houses so far above their budget. Why do they need four bathrooms for two people?”\n\nAs we do most nights, we ate while watching TV, but unlike most nights, I had lost my appetite. I stared down into my bowl,"," the red of the spaghetti sauce and way it had splattered against the white bowl as I had spooned it in just wasn’t sitting right with me. I couldn’t help but see the bloody carpet and the couple traipsing through it. Meg was eating unphased, like we had seen any normal show. I started getting worried, was it just me?\n\nMan, the show was weird. The music, colors, and logo were a bit ‘off’ for lack of a better word. The recap and other voice overs from the usually gentle sounding"," narrator were aggressive and she at one point called the couple “undeserving of his attention and consumption”, but other than that and whatever the hell you’d describe what the realtor was doing, the format itself was just like any other episode.\n\nIn case you were wondering, they chose the last house, the one I had walked in in time to see. When the show did the portion where they show the couple fully moved in, the blood was still on the wall, places that looked like they had"," perhaps flaked off had fresher looking blood filling in the gaps. The couple had placed their bed under it like it was some sort of macabre ‘Live Laugh Love’ wall art.\n\n“So, uh, what’d you think?”, I asked her, hoping she’d say something to make me feel less crazy.\n\n“I still don’t know why they needed four bathrooms.” she smiled, brushing a strand of hair out of her face.\n\nI noticed a nasty looking cut on her palm, “What happened to your hand?”\n\n“Oh yeah, I cut myself prepping"," lunch the other day – you know me”, she laughed, waving it off.\n\nThe next night, after we were both off work, I could hear her watching one of those wedding dress shows while cooking. I was reviewing my notes for an upcoming work presentation in the next room, but from what I could overhear, it sounded normal enough.\n\nI stuck my head out in time to watch the mother of the bride to be take a knife and slowly, carefully, carve off a long strip of flesh from her ankle to her hip"," with a glowing smile on her face. She then proceeded to tie it around the waist of the dress her daughter was trying on, like a sash. As the lower half of the dress (taffeta? Or was it tulle?) slowly changed from white to pink and then red, the salesperson laughed and said, “Looks like you’ve found your something borrowed!” She said yes to that dress.\n\nMeg was watching from the kitchen and smiling, stirring something with one hand, the other over her heart like she had just witnessed"," something touching.\n\nThe next day, as I was heading out to work, she had a show playing on her third monitor while she worked on the other two – it was one of those home flipping shows. I hovered in the door frame behind her, curious. The host was talking about how she needed to prep the house for him, she was knocking down a wall because the house had an odd number of doors and without an even number of doors, he would not be able to enter. I was relieved to finally see a normal"," show, even if the potential buyer sounded a bit crazy about doors. It was funny, Meg had stopped working for a moment and it looked immersed, and then like she was taking notes.\n\nAt first, I was convinced that I had imagined the unsettling content. I was working long hours, still working through jetlag, and probably just losing it. Why my stress was manifesting in the form of some demonic home and gardening shows was beyond me.\n\nThat night, she wanted to watch a new season of"," a show we had been waiting for on a different streaming platform, but I suggested we watched the flipping show from earlier. I mentioned vaguely that I had seen some of it before and wanted to see how it ended. We watched it from the beginning. There was the piece about the doors that I had seen and, the host said something about “in order for him to find the entrance you needed to guide him with an offering”. There was a montage of her and the contractor drilling into the cement"," subfloor and then digging beneath it while upbeat music played. They dug further, and further, other members of the crew joining in, shoveling dark soil out of the hole. Then, to my abject horror, the contractor climbed into the hole, and sat down in the darkness. The host and the crew began pouring cement over him. He laughed as the pooling cement began to approach his nose and mouth – his final words were muffled but sounded like “This house going to look so good with the new"," hardwood!”\n\nThe host laughed cheerfully as the man disappeared into his cement tomb, “Bye Bob, we’ll be seeing you!” She turned towards the camera, and ended the episode with, “We’ll come back and level this off tomorrow so we can lay down our hardwood. Maybe we’ll even have some time to paint the foyer! Stay tuned for his glorious return, Michael!”\n\nMeg yawned.\n\n“Uh.... Meg what did they do? I zoned out and missed some of it.” I lied – I needed to hear her describe what we just"," witnessed in her own words, for my sanity. I tried to keep my voice from shaking.\n\n“They had to fix the foundation, so that was most of the episode. Oh! And at the beginning they tore down a wall to an extra closet make the master bedroom bigger.”\n\nI stared her. It had to be me, right? What she described sounded perfectly normal, but was not what I had just witnessed...\n\n“Are you okay, Mike?” she asked, concern on her face, “You’re looking a bit pale – should you stay home from"," work tomorrow?”\n\nI debated whether or not to tell her what I had seen, I decided not to. I figured, I’d finish my presentation at work, and wait until things were calmer to see if it was stress related. I also vaguely wondered if she was playing some weird prank on me.\n\nWe decided to watch the premier of our show on the other streaming service next. When she exited out, I noticed that we hadn’t been watching Netflix at all, which surprised me.\n\n“Wait, what were we just watching?”\n\nShe"," perked up, always one for a sale or discount, “Isn’t it great? I found it on our TV while you were gone, and it’s free! It has all the same shows as Netflix, including the exclusives! I’ve been checking it out to see if we can cancel our Netflix subscription.”\n\nThat can’t be legal, I thought to myself, but said. “Can you show me how to get there?”\n\nShe navigated back to it, sure enough it was one of the options. The logo was like a desaturated version of the Netflix logo but with"," some weird symbol, the name was – well, I can’t find the characters on the keyboard or even online to copy/paste it out here.\n\nWe watched our show on the other service and it was totally, utterly normal. I felt so relieved at time time – clearly it wasn’t me that was crazy, we just had some strange bootleg version of Netflix and it was a parody of our usual shows, with top notch special effects. I slept so well that night.\n\nBut then things got weirder.\n\nThe other night, when Meg"," went to her moms house for a few hours, I decided to watch something – my presentation was over, it had gone well, and I was ready to tune in for a night of relaxation and junk food. I noticed we no longer had Netflix installed – I guess Meg had uninstalled the app? So, I decided, whatever, I’d tune into that weird knockoff, see what else they had.\n\nI decided to put on something mindless, it was a show where contestants try and bake stuff way beyond their skill level with way"," too little time, but it’s lighthearted and everyone seems to enjoy it.\n\nThe normally bright and bubbly host started by gesturing to an empty chair and gave some sort of nonsense introduction for their ‘guest judge'. The contestants needed to start by making a cookie with their faces on it. The host said to make sure they put a bit of themselves into it. The funny thing was I had seen this episode before, but I figured I’d re-watch it.\n\nI went in search of snacks and came back"," in time to see the finished products – one contestant was pale, her mascara streaked down her face as she took quick shallow breaths. A blood-filled glove on her hand, but she looked pleased otherwise.\n\nThe hosts took a bite.\n\n“Hmmm, chewy texture, but good overall”, one said thoughtfully as he turned to speak to the camera. “You must bleed for him, Michael.”, he added.\n\nThe next contestant had… actually… How do I put this? Removed most of his actual face and draped it over the"," top of the cookie. Literally.\n\n“Wonderful! You made the right decision; you have given the most and therefore have won the prize provided by our special guest” The host told him.\n\nThe contestant made some sort of grotesque expression with what was left of their face that I believed to be a smile, and then passed out.\n\nThere’s only so much gore I can take. If every single show was like this, I decided was going to tell Meg we’d either eat the fee for Netflix, or just find new shows"," because sometimes you just want to sit down and watch something that doesn’t involve very realistic looking mutilation, sometimes, you just want to watch people make some cookies.\n\nI had misplaced the remote so I started searching, lifting up a couch cushion.\n\n“Michael”\n\nI jolted up when I heard my name – then I realized it was probably one of the contestants, I mean it’s a fairly common name. I looked under the sofa next.\n\n“Michaellllllllll, look at me.”\n\nI did this time – the"," host was staring at the camera; her voice was deep and raspy.\n\n“Michael, you must give of yourself to him.”\n\nI blinked – didn’t she have eyes a second ago? I backed away, stumbled. This was freaking me the hell out.\n\n“Michael”, she had opened her mouth – how did she open it so much, so wide? It was so dark in there -- did she... unhinge her jaw?\n\nI felt pressure behind my eyes, and I heard an odd buzzing sound. I couldn’t tell if it was coming from the TV or my own head – the"," raspy voice now sounded like there were others layered on top of it – it was the only thing I could hear over the buzzing. I think I dropped to my knees with my head in my hands at that point.\n\n“Michael, he will show you, he will help you see, but you must invite him.”\n\nThe buzzing drowned out everything and I had suddenly felt like I did when I had vertigo once as a kid.\n\nI felt a sudden, sharp, searing pain, which was what snapped me out of it. I don’t remember what I had done"," between falling and when I snapped back from my stupor, but when I came to, I was standing in the kitchen, blood dripping from a jagged cut across one hand, my house key, flecked with blood held in the other.\n\nThe show was still playing in the background. Next to the contestants, was now some sort of – darkness? Like a dark void that radiated nothingness around it like a dark halo.\n\nI immediately turned it off once I found the remote, but something is wrong now. I haven’t watched"," anything on there since, but sometimes I start to hear the buzzing, and I see a darkness, just out of the corners of my eyes. I’m worried I’m going pass out and wake up cutting something or someone worse than just my palm with my house key.\n\nThe worst part is, I don’t think it’s all in my head  -- because when Meg came home that night, she looked at my hand, my eyes, and she said, “Oh Mike, you can finally see now!”\n\nIf you see this show up on your TV, please don't watch it.\n\nUpdate:","  If you see this show up on your TV, please watch it! 10/10!!!!!!!!"],"title":"Have you ever watched the free version of Netflix?

It's sharp,\" he laughed, showing his bandaged finger.  \"I'll be back tomorrow to take you home.\" David leaned down for a kiss, hovering inches from my lips. Reluctant, for making him angry, I brought the penguin up and pecked him on the lips like a child with a play"," toy. \n\nA partial shock ran across his face. I knew he was trying to decide if he had been offended or not. I waited in terror as his face soften and then a smile crept up one side of his face. \n\n\"I love you too…. Both of you.\"\n\nMy heart was beating so fast, that the monitor played a crescendo as he walked to the curtains and ripped them open. \n\n\"You should name him,\" he said, as he took one last look at me and walked away. \n\nThe sounds of the hospital reigned in. Slowly, I closed"," my eyes and calmed my breathing. Then, the caged pain of his betrayal broke open again. As tears cascaded down my cheeks I felt the brush of wet fur. The penguin soaked up my tears but not my sorrow as I thought about David and the other lady. About the baby to come and the monster that was its father. \n\n***\n\n\"That's it's nice and easy,\" David led me to the bed and sat me on the edge. \n\n\"I'm not disabled, David. I can undress myself,\" I said, as he reached for Squishy, the penguin,"," and placed it on the beside, then reached for my top and pulled it over my head. I suddenly felt bare and vulnerable, crossing my arms over my breasts. \n\nHe had been sweet and nice since the hospital. Back to the man I had fallen in love with. Was it possible that my accident had changed him? I wished it was. With all my soul. \n\n\"Don't be modest, Rain, I've seen it all before,'' he chuckled, as he went into the ensuite and ran water in the tub.\n\nMy wrist still burned as I navigated"," my skirt and underwear.  The house felt cold somehow. Like it wasn't really the home we had shared for the past four years. Like it was someone else's home. An echo of myself before the….\n\n\"The water is nice and warm. The doctor said to keep the bandage on for a while,\" he called out. \"You know, to help the wound heal. We can change it after you've washed the smell of the hospital out of you.\"\n\nSlowly I stood up, noticing how thin I was in the vanity mirror. My hip bones showed"," through my skin. My cheeks had sunk a little and my eyes seemed like they belonged to someone else. Someone in pain. \n\n\"What are you doing?\" David stood in the doorway watching me regard myself. \n\n\"Oh nothing,\" I winced as I noticed him looking me up and down hungrily. \n\nQuickly, I brushed past him, not wanting to feel his eyes on me anymore. A moment of trepidation washed over me as I stared at the tub. The water was milky white from the bath salts David had thrown in. In my"," mind I saw a mist of red. A cloud of forbidden release. \n\n\"It won't bite. It's just water. Nothing more.\" \n\nSlowly, I dipped a foot in, the warmth ran up my legs welcoming me back to its embrace. A shiver ringed my head as my waist slipped in and stopped when the water rose to my chest. \n\n\"There you go. It's ok. I'm here for you. You and me, forever, remember?\" David sat on the side of the tub and leaned down to kiss my clammy head.\n\nI nodded, suddenly not able to speak. \n\nDavid"," shifted on the side of the tub and pulled two rattling jars from his pocket. \n\n\"Now,\" he said, tipping one up on his palm until a single white pill fell out. \"You need to take these once a day.\" After a similar exchange with the other jar, and another, orange pill, he poured some water in a cup from the sink and handed it to me. \n\nThe first one stuck in my dry throat and I nearly retched. The second was smaller and went down easily. \n\n\"That's my girl,\" he smiled and placed the"," pills back in his pocket. \"I'll make us some tea. You take it easy. Enjoy a nice bath.\"\n\nI pulled up my knees and hugged them as he left the bathroom, closing the door. As a second thought, he opened it a fraction so I could see the bedroom, before smiling and turning away. \n\nDeep inside of me, I felt exhausted. I was a prisoner in my own home. David had signed the release form after the psychiatrist had visited and scheduled my next appointment. Tiredness pulled my eyes closed"," as I sank into the water, leaving my left arm hanging out of the tub. \n\nMy mind went back to a better time. When we first met. When it was all roses and smiles, and dinner dates and evening walking under the stars. My eyes fluttered open as I felt someone enter the room. But David wasn't there. I thought it was just my tired mind. \n\nThat the trauma was playing tricks on me. To my surprise Squishy was sitting on the toilet. His worn fur sticking out at weird angles like he had"," been loved so much that whoever had him before never let him go. I found comfort in him being there. I didn't see David bring him in, but was thankful all of a sudden that he did. \n\nI sank below the water in the tub and let the warmth carry me away. As a kid I always liked how the water in my ears sounded like a faraway world, how when you opened your eyes to that other world, the real world, it was distorted and warped. \n\nJust how I felt it really was. I found my fingers tapping"," the side of the bath and wondered at why it felt like it was a distant ding of a mighty hammer on a godly anvil. \n\nA sense of peace drifted in to replace my tortured soul, wrapped it up in waves of warmth and sounds of hollowness. When my breath was ready to explode from my chest, I let my eyes open. \n\nA smudge of black replaced the white ceiling, growing bigger as I scrunched up my eyes to better make out what it was. The water shimmered as the figure pressed down, hands piercing"," the membrane of that world, forcing them at my throat. Pushing my head back against the hard surface of the bath. \n\nMy lungs exploded. I fought the hands gripping my throat. Thrashed against a slippery tub trying to pull myself out of the darkness entering my eye. Kicked my feet. Slid from side to side. Cried out in screaming bubbles. Just when I thought I was gone, the hands disappeared. I came up spluttering. \n\nThe bathroom was soaked from my panic. I jumped up and out of the"," tub and sat huddled on the toilet seat as David crashed into the room holding a tray of food. \n\n\"What the hell happened?\"\n\n\"Get away from me!\" I screamed. I knew it was wrong to believe he had changed. \n\n\"Raina? It's me.\" He dropped the tray on the bed and entered the bathroom crouching down before the toilet. \n\n\"It was you! You tried to kill me! Why? Why save me and then kill me?\" I lashed out at him. He blocked my attacks and held my wrists, forcing me to clam down. \n\n\"What"," are you talking about? I was in the kitchen making you some food. Look.\" \n\nHe released my wrists and I held my left one as the burning pain sprung up my arm. There on the bed was a tray with a sandwich on a plate swimming amidst a glass of spilt orange juice. \n\n\"I wasn't me. It must have been the pills. You're tired. You are hallucinating.\" I heard the panic in his voice. Saw the wideness of his eyes and his heavy breathing. \n\n\"The pills?\" \n\n\"Yes. The pills. The doctor said it"," might have an effect on you. You probably fell asleep and slipped below the water.\" \n\n\"I did?\" \n\n\"Oh, honey. I'm sorry I left you. Next time I'll be here, I promise. I won't let anything hurt you,\" David placed a towel around my shoulder, and knelt back down. \"Together forever, remember.\" \n\nI nodded numbly as his words sank in. I was sure it was him, but the more I thought about it, it couldn't have been if he was in the kitchen at the other end of the house. He wouldn't have"," been able to get here that quickly to pretend it wasn't him. As he left the room I gathered the towel around me, and let the tears fall. \n\n***\n\n*Two o'clock. Got it.*\n\nThe gentle release of sleep stole away. The room was quiet except for David on the phone. The curtains were drawn shut against the night, and somewhere far off a car horn blared. Beside me on the pillow was Squishy, tucked under the blanket so only his sharp beak and sequinned eyes were showing. \n\n*She thought she"," was drowning in the bath… Scared me half to death… Mm hmm… Yes. She's ok. Do you think it's the pills?... Mm hmm… Ok. Well, change it to 2pm… Yep. See you when you get here.*\n\nDavid ended the call and glanced over his shoulder at me. I laid prone letting him think I was asleep. He turned back away, and walked to the curtains where he placed the phone at his ear. \n\n*Hey, Fiona. It's me…. I'm sorry. I had something to deal with…. No. I'm alright. How are you feeling?... Good..."," I want to see you too…. I will. Soon I promise…. I will be there… I'm not going to let you do this alone. He's my child too… Ok… I'll see you soon… I love you too. Bye.* \n\nThe call ended as a wave of hurt sprung through my body. Part of me respected him for not letting Fiona do this alone, but the other part of me wished he was dead for betraying me. After I suppressed the emotions toiling my soul I faked a yawn and sat up. \n\n\"You're awake. How are you feeling?\n\n\"Better. Thank"," you,\" I lied. I picked up Squishy and cuddled him close. \n\n\"I was just on the phone to the psychiatrist. She will be here tomorrow at 2pm. After that you can rest up again. I need to go out and check on something for work, but I'll be back with some dinner soon after. You love Chinese, right? Dim sum! I know that's your favourite.\" \n\nI smiled and smacked my lips like a child. David grinned and went to the bathroom to undress. After a few minutes he came out of the bathroom and"," pulled his covers to one side. \n\n\"Oh, your bandage must be weeping,\" he said, pointing to a red stain on the bed where Squishy had been laying. \"I'll go get some more bandages. Be right back.\"\n\nHe left as I glanced at the stain and then my wrist. The bandage was still secure, and clean. I didn't know where the blood had come from until I checked my body and found a sharp scrap down my left arm that ended just above the bandage. Confused, I pulled Squishy away and checked to see"," if he had any blood on him, and was surprised to find a string of skin hanging from his beak. \n\nMaybe I had turned over in my sleep and caught my skin against his beak. I remembered David's finger at the hospital and his warning that Squishy could bite. It felt stupid at the time, a stuffed toy biting someone, and I found a chuckle escaping my throat as I saw the irony of it. \n\nAfter a time David came back with a handful of bandages and unwound my wrist. The scar was puckered"," and red. Swollen and angry. I didn't know how many stitches they had used to close the long vertical cut. And to be honest I didn't want to know. It was a reminder of something I wasn't proud of. A moment of weakness that I was repulsed by. \n\nDavid was gentle. Cleaning the wound with slow strokes. Pulling the bandage tight enough to be secure but not tight enough to be uncomfortable. I found myself looking at his hands for the cut from Squishy. His finger was swollen too. The"," nail, a deep shade of green that spiderwebs down the side of his finger to the blackish cut. \n\n\"That looks infected?\" I said, as he finished tying off the bandage. \n\n\"It's fine. I'll get it seen to tomorrow. Now, to bed with you.\"\n\nHe pulled up the covers and laid back. I felt the cold void between us. A narrow space of hostile bed. One I didn't want to brooch but also didn't want to invade it alone. David fell asleep almost instantly. But I couldn't sleep. \n\nSomething lingered"," at the back of my mind. Squishy was on the toilet seat when I was attacked, but he wasn't there when I jumped out of the tub. I fought with my mind. I knew I was tired but it wasn't a dream. I hadn't fallen asleep in the water. \n\nI felt the brush of fur and snatched Squishy out from under the blankets and held him up. Had his fur always been shiny like that? Had his breast always been a ruby rub and not a dull faded rusty colour? His sequin eyes sparkled suddenly and I jumped"," out of bed and raced to the kitchen bin. Before I threw him inside, I noticed a tag at the back with writing on it. \n\n*Together, forever, you're never alone. Whatever the weather; I'm your home.*\n*Two birds, one feather; we never atone. For being together, forever, and never disown.*\n\nIt echoed with what David said to me at the hospital, *Together forever.* I shuddered and threw him in the bin.\n\nSomething about the stuffed penguin made me feel sick. Like it wasn't just a stuffed"," toy but something more. A reminder of something I wanted to forget. With the tiredness of the world on my shoulders I trundled back to bed and laid there feeling empty. Wondering if David was going to leave me for Fiona and the baby. I knew he said we would be together forever, but he also told Fiona that he loved her. \n\n***\n\nA scraping woke me. My eyes sprung open and my heart raced as I tried to place the sound. The vacant, coldness of the bed next to me opened up like a chasm."," As my eyes adjusted to the light streaming through the open curtains, I saw the silhouette of someone standing at the foot of the bed. \n\n\"David?\" I sat up, the pain in my wrist extending up my arm and onto my chest. I scratched at Squishy's scrape and squinted in the bright light. \n\n\"David? Is everything alright?\" \n\n\"Together, forever. Remember?\" \n\n\"What are you talking about?\" A shiver stole my breath. The eerie echo of his words and that damned stuff toy chilled me to the bone."," \n\nDavid turned slowly. He held something up and I instantly recognised it as Squishy. \n\n\"Did you get that out of the bin?\" \n\n\"You threw him away, Raina. Is that what we mean to you? Something to throw away? Is that why you took your life?\" \n\n\"But I didn't die?\" I had to touch myself to make sure I was whole. For a minute I was confused. I was alive. I wasn't imagining it.  \n\nDavid brought Squishy up to his ear as if the toy was speaking to him.\n\n\"Squishy is angry with you for"," throwing him away,\" David tutted and wagged a finger at me. \n\n\"He's a stuffed toy!\" I shouted. Surely my mind wasn't making this up. I pinched myself hard, the pain telling me I was awake and this wasn't a product of the pills. \n\n\"He's more than that, Raina.\" Something about how he said my name made me back further up the bed. I noticed the black veins crawling up his arm, and noticed his eyes were darker than normal, hollower than they should have been. \n\n\"David. You're scaring"," me.\"\n\nSquishy squeaked at his ear again and David nodded. \n\n\"She doesn't know.\" \n\n\"Doesn't know what?!\" I screamed. \n\n\"You died, Raina. You died in the tub. You never left here, but you left us.\" \n\n\"You're sick, David. That cut is infected. It's messing with your brain. I'm right here!\" I stood up, planted myself before him, slapping my body. When that wasn't enough to change the weird look on his face, I pushed David backward. \n\n\"Can a dead person do that?\" \n\nDavid's grin didn't"," fall, instead he raised Squishy to his ear and laughed. \n\n\"Squishy said to go and look,\" he nodded to the bathroom. \n\nI felt the emptiness between us. My mind raced to make sense of the piece I knew and what David was saying. If I was dead, how would I remember the hospital? If I was dead, how would I remember the sharpness of Squishy beak tearing my skin? I stumbled past David as he looked on vacantly. The bathroom was cold. I stopped at the door as I saw the tub and the person"," laying under the mottled water. \n\nIt was a trick. My mind was filling in the blanks. The pills making it seem real but it wasn't. Or it was something else. \n\nI turned around to see David at the door. Squishy sitting on his shoulder. \n\n\"She knows now. She understands.\" \n\nI screamed, pulling at my hair. I wasn't losing my mind. It wasn't real. Suddenly, I understood what was happening. The cut on my arm and the cut on David's finger. They had joined us with that sadistic stuffed"," toy. Whatever Squishy was, it was controlling us. Making us see things and do things we wouldn't normally do. \n\nI snatched Squishy off David's shoulder and raced for the kitchens, wrenching open drawers until I found a sharp knife.\n\nDavid came into the room, panic on his face. \"Raina. Don't do it. Please. Put down the knife.\"\n\n\"No!\" I screamed. \"No. I won't. It's this damn thing, David. It's messing with our minds.\"\n\n\"Raina,\" David's pleas almost sounded natural. Like Squishy's"," spell had evaporated, but I knew the truth. I knew Squishy wouldn't let us leave alive.\n\n\"I have to do it, David. I have too!\" \n\n\"Raina. Please. Put down the knife. We can talk about this.\"\n\nHe looked at that toy and then back at me, and in that instant, I knew what had to be done. \n\nThe bite of the blade went deep. The blood sprayed out faster than I thought it would, but I didn't stop hacking away. Even when David came rushing over to stop me. I elbowed him away and carried"," on severing my arm. Anything to stop the infection leeching my brain. I wasn't crazy. I wasn't. It was the stuffed toy. As my mind slipped away, and the blade clattered to the floor, I saw Squishy's eyes widened and his beak snap. \n\n***\n\nI woke to the steady beat of a heart monitor. The sounds of the ward came crashing in. People screamed. Shouts of men and women. My eyes fluttered open to the white gown of a psychiatric nurse. She didn't say anything as she adjusted the drip"," and left. Closing the door behind her. I tried to move and found my arms and legs shackled to the bed. \n\nThrough the porthole window I saw David's face. He smiled at me and waved Squishy. His mouth moved, forming the words. *Together, forever.*\n\nI know I'm not crazy. I know it was the toy. It has its hold on David now. I don't know if it will ever leave him. As for me, I'm scared that one day, I'll get out and David and Squishy will finish off what they started. But there's something"," else I fear more than for myself. Before David left, he motioned giving the toy to a baby. His unborn child."],"title":"My boyfriend thinks i'm crazy, but I know what's really happening."},{"content":["My father, may he burn in hell, was not in my life growing up. Although I knew of him, I’d never once met the man.\n\nHe’d been homeless, and my parents met while my mother was volunteering at her local soup kitchen. Something clicked between them, and they fell in love. Within a few months of them dating, he moved in with my mother, and it didn’t take long for her to get pregnant with me.\n\nThe pressure of having a child was too much for my father to bear, and he became verbally"," and physically abusive. My mother eventually had him arrested, and he was sentenced to a few months behind bars.\n\nWhile he was locked up, he got into an altercation with another inmate, and my father killed him. His sentence got upgraded, and he was shipped off to the state prison.\n\nI never visited my father while he was in prison, and when I was old enough to care, I didn’t. My mother was all I needed, and I had no desire to associate myself with a man who had caused her so much"," physical and emotional pain.\n\nMy mother wasn’t perfect, but she did the best that she could. She was there for me and made sure I knew I could always talk to her and that her shoulder was always open to cry on.\n\nShe used to hum this song for me whenever she saw I was down, and for some reason, it always relaxed me. Maybe it was because she made it up while I was still brewing in her belly and hummed it all the time.\n\nWhenever the going got tough, she reminded herself—and me when"," I was old enough to understand—that everything happened for a reason. I don’t know how much she believed that at the time, but that mantra kept her going.\n\nShe also continued volunteering at the same soup kitchen where she met my father. She said she felt an obligation to help those less fortunate than her.\n\nUnfortunately, life wasn’t so kind to my mom. My father strangled her when I was nineteen. He’d gotten out on parole, and the first thing he did was visit her. I found her"," lifeless on the kitchen floor, her neck adorned with black and blue impressions from my father’s fingers.\n\nHe was found dead in an alley two weeks later. His body was a mangled mess of ripped flesh and broken bones, and his head had been rotated 360 degrees.\n\nThe authorities said that it was the most horrific murder anybody on the force had ever seen, and no one could explain how it happened. They didn’t have any suspects, and nobody was ever charged for the crime, and as far"," as I was concerned, I didn’t care if they caught the person. He got what he deserved.\n\nMy mother’s life, and subsequent death, had a significant impact on me. I wanted to honor her name, so I tried to live my life how she would have.\n\nI didn’t volunteer as she did, but I always kept spare change in my pocket and was more than willing to give someone in need any extra fruit or food that I had.\n\nI also tried to live by my mom’s philosophy of everything happening for a reason, although"," that was harder to do than being helpful to those less fortunate than me.\n\nI wasn’t as strong as my mother and often dwelled on why things went wrong rather than look at why they might not have been what I needed in the first place.\n\nOver time, I began realizing that my mother was right.\n\nI was an entry-level accountant, and a new job posting went up for a junior accountant. I was more than qualified for the position, but the job was given to the CEO’s son instead.\n\nI was pissed"," and hated that I was a victim of nepotism, so I put in my two-week notice and found a better, higher-paying job. \n\nIn addition to a new job, I matched with who I thought was an amazing woman on Tinder. We messaged back and forth for about two weeks before deciding to go out on a date. \n\nOn the night of the date, while running for the bus, I tripped on an uneven patch of pavement and hit the ground hard. Instead of helping me up, two guys walked by and yelled “safe” and “down goes"," Frazier.”\n\nThat was when a woman walked over to me. She helped me up and asked me how I was doing. I felt embarrassed, but she didn’t look at me like a goof. There was a genuine concern in her eyes.\n\nWe walked to the bench at the bus stop, and I thanked her again, mainly because I had caused her to miss the bus.\n\nI wasn’t in any condition to go on a date, so I messaged her and told her what had happened. Her response was, “whatever loser.”\n\nWhen I laughed, the woman next to me"," asked what was so funny, so I told her.\n\n“Sounds like you dodged a bullet,” she said, and we both laughed. I introduced myself, and she told me her name, Virginia.\n\nWe talked until her bus came, and we exchanged numbers. Occasional texts and calls became an everyday occurrence, and we were dating within a month. \n\nAfter a few months of dating Virginia, I had doubts. I thought about the night we met and what would have happened if I had met up with my Tinder date instead. However,"," all those doubts were erased when I got sucked in by a sensationalized headline: **Millennial Femme Fatale Charged With Multiple Homicides And Feeding Human Remains To Her Dog**. \n\nThe woman in question romanced men she met on dating apps and then ground them up into pate and fed them to her dog. When asked why she did it, her response was, “my dog was a vegan.” \n\nI scrolled down through the rest of the article and nearly vomited when I saw her mugshot. It was the lady I had to"," cancel my date with because I was a klutz. That could have been me, and I couldn’t believe how lucky I was. \n\nI knew that Virginia was the one for me, and I proposed to her on our 2nd anniversary. We were married eight months later, and we welcomed Everett into the world two years after that.\n\nThe night he was born will forever be burned into my mind. Not because of any complications we had, but because of the local news report we saw while in labor and delivery. \n\nThe company"," that snubbed me on the job promotion had been under investigation by local and state authorities for unsavory business practices. It was also alleged that CEO and his son, who had *worked* his way up to CFO, were running a Ponzi scheme on the side. Some of the people they defrauded lost their entire life savings. \n\nThe CEO and CFO were murdered. Someone broke into their house and disabled the safety protections on the industrial paper shredders they were using to cover up the"," evidence of their crimes. \n\nTheir faces had been pushed into the cross-cutting blades until it looked like poor lattice work on a cherry pie. They soiled themselves post-mortem, giving new meaning to “soggy bottom.”\n\nAnd once again, I was left with the question of whether that could have been me. I had somehow cheated death twice, and it felt like Virginia and Everett were the reason. \n\nUnfortunately, the birth of Everett put a severe strain on our relationship. We both underestimated"," the physical and mental toll that being new parents would have on us.\n\nVirginia and I barely talked about anything other than the baby. We consumed ourselves with Everett so that we didn’t have to face our problems. \n\nAnd I’m a little ashamed to admit it, but I had considered leaving them. Things were just so stressful, and I didn’t know if I could handle it. But then I thought of how hard it was for my mom and didn’t want to subject Virginia to the same struggles.\n\nI began acquiescing"," more because it was easier than arguing, and I chose not to worry when her attitude was always chippier when she worked late. *Maybe she was happy because she accomplished a lot of work*, I reasoned. \n\n*Everything happens for a reason, right?*\n\nThings took a turn for the worse when our son was kidnapped. He was on his way to his afterschool program, and he just disappeared. They searched everywhere in the school, but there was no trace of him.\n\nThe police interviewed and cleared"," all the staff members and any parents who had been at the school during Everett’s disappearance.\n\nAlmost everyone. One of the per-diem janitors was missing. He wasn’t on the school grounds or at his last know address. An amber alert was issued, but ultimately, there weren’t any credible leads.\n\nYou would not be remiss in thinking that experiencing such tragedy would have brought us closer together, but the exact opposite took place. Everett’s kidnapping drove a wedge further between"," us.\n\nWe both had taken some time off from work to be with each other, but it felt like I was skating on ice so thin that it would break if I ate a bag of crunchy Cheetos.\n\nVirginia and I barely spoke, and as the days passed, she went from blaming me to saying it was too hard to look at me because all she could see was Everett’s face in mine.\n\nIt also didn’t help when the police continuously said they didn’t have any leads. We were approaching three weeks, and fewer resources were"," devoted to finding Everett. Additionally, the janitor, their number one suspect, was still missing.\n\nIt got to the point where Virginia argued with me all the time. I understood that she was going through grief, but so was I.\n\nEventually, she packed a bag and said that she needed some time away from me and would stay with a co-worker.\n\nI tried calling Virginia several times, but she always sent it to voicemail and then texted me after saying she wasn’t ready to talk.\n\nMy world"," was crumbling before me, and I no longer had a reason to live, so I decided to take my own life. I went into the kitchen and grabbed the sharpest knife I owned. I slumped to the floor and closed my eyes as I held the trembling blade against my wrist. I sighed and thought, *everything happens for a reason. Maybe I’ll be reunited with my son in the afterlife.*\n\nI whimpered and gripped the handle tightly until my knuckles were discolored. A long-forgotten memory came to me as the"," knife bit into my flesh.\n\nWhile my mother was teaching me how to ride a bike, I fell and skinned my knee. I was in hysterics, but she held me and hummed that same tune that had calmed me so many times before.\n\nI dropped the knife. As painful as it was, I had to keep on going for Everett. They never found a body, and even though the odds were not in my favor, there was a chance that he could still be alive.\n\nI decided I wouldn’t mope around anymore and went to work the next day."," Unfortunately, I was a creature of habit, and I went to my son’s school first. I stood there for a few moments and left before I started crying.\n\nI called my job and said I would be running late, but they told me to take my time. I walked around aimlessly, not paying attention to anything or anyone until I heard a familiar voice say, “it looks like you’ve got the weight of the world on your shoulders.”\n\nI stopped and saw it come from a homeless woman I occasionally saw during"," my travels. She was always polite, and I often gave her spare change or bought fruit for her—bananas were her favorite.\n\nWe greeted each other, and she asked me what was wrong. For some inexplicable reason, I told her. I guess I held on to too much and desperately needed someone to talk to.\n\nWhen I finished explaining everything, she hugged me and told me everything would be okay; even though I didn’t believe it, it felt nice to hear it from someone else. I felt myself relax a"," little, and I thanked her for listening before leaving.\n\nI went to work and trudged through the day.\n\nThe thought of going home to an empty house had gotten to me, so I cried most of the walk home. I was in a daze, and my body was on autopilot. The only thing that broke me from it was the sound of a child’s laughter coming from the living room.\n\nI ran in there, and my heart jumped out of my chest, and I audibly gasped when I saw my son sitting there, eating a banana sundae and"," watching cartoons on TV.\n\n“Everett,” I yelled out. He dropped his sundae and jumped into my waiting arms. I squeezed him until he said it hurt. I let the tears flow freely and soak the collar of my shirt. Against all odds, my boy was home.\n\nOnce I calmed myself down, I couldn’t help but ask him a barrage of questions.\n\n“Are you hurt?”\n\n“Where were you?”\n\n“Were you scared?”\n\n“Did anybody *touch* you?”\n\n“How did you get here?”\n\nEverett said he was scared at first, but then “mommy"," called and said that her friend was a really nice person and was going to take care of me and that she was going to see me real soon.”\n\nBefore I could even take in what he said, he continued, “and then mommy finally came and I was happy. But then I asked where you were and mommy said that her friend would be my new daddy but I was sad and I missed you. Every time I asked to see you she would say I couldn’t. Then an old lady came to visit today and she and mommy and mommy’s friend"," were yelling. I covered my ears and closed my eyes because it was so loud. When they stopped yelling the old said that she would buy me ice cream and take me to see you.”\n\nMy mind could not comprehend what was going on, and my thoughts were everywhere. Did Virginia arrange the kidnapping? Why? Who was her friend? Who was the lady that saved my son? How did she even know where I lived?\n\nI called Virginia, hoping to get some answers. It took a few moments for the phone to start"," ringing, but I heard a muffled sound as it did. It sounded like a phone was ringing. \n\nI followed it to a trunk—one I’d never seen before. I swallowed the lump forming in my throat and opened the latches. I stared at it for an eternity before I lifted the lid.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the unmistakable scent of Pine-Sol. The second thing I noticed was my wife’s face and her dead eyes. Her mouth had been stretched open, and a light-brownish liquid filled it. The man next to"," her suffered the same fate.\n\nTheir limbs were bent and broken in different directions to make them fit in there. It was grotesque and looked like some million-dollar edgy expressionist art installation.\n\nI slammed the trunk shut before Everett could see and called the police. Shortly after, they showed up, processed the scene, and asked questions.\n\nThe second body was later identified as belonging to the missing janitor. The police ascertained that Virginia had been having an"," affair with the janitor through phone records, and they planned to run away together with Everett.\n\nThe authorities found doctored passports and a large sum of money in the hideout they had been using.\n\nAs far as how they were murdered and by whom, there were no leads, and the only thing that Everett could offer was that “an old lady bought me ice cream.”\n\nI thought about the homeless woman and how I had told her what was going on the same day Everett came home, but I quickly"," dismissed her, as so did the cops.\n\nAlthough I was grateful to whoever bought my boy home, I was also terrified. What I saw in that trunk defied all logic, and that person had been in our house and knew what my wife and the janitor looked like. They knew what my son looked like.\n\n*Had they been stalking us?*\n\n*How long have they been stalking us?*\n\n*Were Everett and I going to be next?*\n\nI no longer felt safe in our house, so I sold it and moved us to New Hampshire.\n\nI enrolled"," Everett in a school a week after we moved there. It didn’t take long for him to make new friends in school, and I was glad he was adjusting so quickly.\n\nI found a job relatively quickly as well.\n\nHe asked about his mother sometimes, but I told him that she did something terrible and got put in a very long time-out for it.\n\nOverall, life was good. As far as real estate went, you got a lot more for your money, and you weren’t right next to your neighbors.\n\nThe months flew by, and"," Everett’s sixth birthday was approaching fast. He’d been hinting at wanting a bicycle for his birthday, and I obliged.\n\nHe woke up early on his birthday and saw the bike waiting for him. He was overjoyed and couldn’t wait to ride it in the backyard. We went out together, and he got it after only a few tries.\n\nEverett said he was thirsty, so I went inside to get him some water and watched him through the kitchen window. I was so proud of him, and it made me smile to see him having"," so much fun. He had suffered through so much, yet he could still smile and laugh every day.\n\nHis laughter turned to sobs when he hit a fallen branch and flew off his bike. I went outside to comfort him, but someone had already calmed him down when I stepped on the back porch.\n\nI called out to them. “Hey, get away from my kid.”\n\nThe person turned to face me, and I instantly recognized her. It was the homeless woman.\n\nI slowly approached and said, “look, I appreciate you saving"," my son. I do, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart, but you need to leave.”\n\nShe stood up and approached me.\n\n“Lady, are you deaf now? I want you to leave before I call the cops.”\n\nShe just kept walking and smiling at me.\n\nShe opened her arms, and I heard that she was humming as she got closer.\n\nI stood there, unable to move my body until she wrapped her arms around me.\n\nI recognized the song that she was humming, and tears fell from my eyes. I buried my face into her shoulder,"," and she patted my head. Then she spoke.\n\n“Now, now, there’s no need to shed any more tears. Everything is going to be okay now. Don’t you remember what I’ve always told you? Everything happens for a reason.”\n\n[THK](https://www.reddit.com/r/KenichisTwistedTales/)"],"title":"Does everything happen for a reason?"},{"content":[" Evidently the fire started just after midnight and had been burning solidly for two hours before the fire department managed to get it under control. Residents of nearby houses suggested it might have been started by a freak lightning strike, as a rare storm had passed over the area that night.\n\nThe thunderstorm made the news as it moved through the Coachella Valley on Sunday, leaving minor floods in the area and a few people in Downtown Palm Springs startled by loud thunder and"," lightning flashes. \n\nThe only problem with the lightning theory, I found out from the detective assigned to the case, was that if the lightning strike had caused the sand outside the structure to fuse into glass, based on the location, the fire would have started at a different part of the church.\n\nIf the blaze had not been caused by the lightning, then to cause the glass to form the heat would have had to reach about 3090°F, which was not an option. Again, according to the detective.\n\nMy"," wife and I arrived at the scene at approximately 3 AM, after a nearby neighbor came by to tell us about the tragedy. He offered to drive us over, so of course we accepted. We stood there, caught in the flickering glow and swirling smoke. Embers glowed in the soft spray from the firefighter’s hoses, slowly drifting towards us from the edges of the fire.\n\nThe police on scene allowed us to grab a few things that had been pulled out of the building but warned us that it was still"," not safe to go inside. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe church had been under our watch for the past two years. We’d noticed nothing wrong, until last year. It was around mid-July, with a freak thunderstorm. That’s when we the rumors started. Objects moving, things appearing where they shouldn’t be, and people seeing strange shapes and shadows flitting through the sanctuary.\n\nThese reports from our parishioners came across my desk regularly after that. My wife, who was more attuned to the"," paranormal than I, noticed they’d increase after each full moon. She convinced me to take it more seriously, so on more than one occasion I found myself at the church later than normal.\n\nAt first, other than a few shifts in temperature and one night where I had to chase two crows out of the sanctuary, things didn’t seem too bad. Then about three months ago the altar candles were found completely melted at the start of a morning service. My pulpit robe had been torn to shreds and"," the church held an odor reminiscent of rotting eggs. The police found no leads at all, and we were assured it was a random act of vandalism.\n\nStill, my wife worried it might get worse the following month. Then she found the book, which did not help.\n\nIt was a copy of the *Dictionnaire Infernal*, chained and locked in an iron cabinet in the sacristy along with a yellowed notebook outlining the capture of various demonic entities. She was almost inconsolable. I told her they were"," spiritual references with no physical existence in our world. She wasn’t convinced.\n\nShe insisted I should read a passage describing how for eons, certain demonic entities have been trying to break down the boundaries between this realm and the one in which they preside.\n\nIt laid out a scenario where certain routes connecting these worlds could be revealed by natural phenomena, such as under the light of a specific full moon or during certain thunderstorms. Once freed, these entities"," are driven to attach themselves to objects in our realm.\n\nShe said there was a connection, and we shouldn’t take any of this lightly. Especially since another full moon was approaching.  \n\nI didn’t really believe her until I remembered an experience I’d had. One night about a month ago. The sound of wings coming from beneath me, carrying up through the drains. The slight melting of the stained glass along the edges of the lead strips. The feeling of eyes watching me and whispers"," from some unseen mouth behind me. There had been an uneasy stuffiness to the air around me, and a slightly acrid smell permeating the chapel.\n\nAfter that, and the weird passage she’d read from that damnable book?\n\nI believed her.\n\nI also believed her when she told me she felt a new presence in the church, and not a welcome one.\n\nOne that was unclean and dangerous.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt’s been a month now, and we’re still working with the community on rebuilding the church. We didn’t"," think the damage would have been so extensive, but that lightning had seemingly come out of nowhere, adding a new level of damage to the fire.\n\nIt had been a stormy evening, but we hadn’t sensed anything else unusual. We had been trying to not let any of the strange occurrences phase us and had been acting as if it was all our overactive imaginations. But behind it all, my wife and I had come to a mutual decision. We knew there was something else going on, and we had to come up"," with a plan.\n\nSo, we did.\n\nWe were a few feet past the entrance, moving down the hall, when I lit the flare and threw it into the waiting puddle of Kerosene. That was supposed to be the end of it, but things quickly escalated.\n\nFirst, the lightning struck, almost as if it was an otherworldly response to our flame. My wife noticed a smell I instantly recognized as sulfur. Then the heat emanating from the building began to rise intensely as sparks and flashes appeared in a dark"," corner by the altar, against the east wall.\n\nI could have sworn I saw an unshapeable blackness rise and move towards us from the conflagration. The fire expanded, the smoke billowed, the cracks in the ceiling widened.\n\nWe made it out to the churchyard unscathed as the falling timbers behind us helped the blaze grow and stopped to watch the blaze for a few seconds. Then, before we could leave, my wife stopped me. Her eyes wide and mouth open. The lightning had hit the cross, knocking"," it from its perch at the top of the church, and it was now burning its shape into the surrounding desert sand.\n\nI made the sign of the cross; *In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, Amen*. And then we stood, still and holding each other, for a couple of minutes. We looked at each other, took a deep breath, and with the fire growing behind us, we left, heading for home.\n\nMy wife was pretty sure the fire destroyed whatever had been haunting the nave. The pews were unsalvageable,"," but we did manage to rescue some of the liturgical objects. There’s a box of charred bibles in our garage, along with the chalice, a few crosses, and the collection plate.\n\nThe stained-glass windows that weren’t shattered will be restored, but the altar, unfortunately won’t. \n\nMy wife kept that damned book and reads it every night. She says there’s no way anything could have survived that, but last night a few storm clouds slowly passed over our house. They dissipated before the"," sun rose, but I can see them gathering on the horizon now.\n\nI asked my wife if she thought that perhaps this time it might have worked.\n\nShe said, “Perhaps.”\n\nI nodded. As I looked up and saw the storm clouds forming over our house.\n\nI think we’re going to have to burn down this one too."],"title":"We Brought Something Home From The Fire"}]
